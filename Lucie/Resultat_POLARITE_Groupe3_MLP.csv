We called over the manager who was the general manager and he told us that prime rib is served at room temperature.  He was not at all sorry and did nothing to make us happy.  The water, coffee, etc. never got refilled unless we flagged down the waitress.
She was not at all nice or helpful.  One prime rib was sent back and it came out 2 minutes later - the same piece only it was microwaved (we were told that) and the other prime rib was sent back with instructions not to microwave and send out a new piece.

The menu is simple, you have either sandwich or platter of pulled pork, brisket, or chicken. I like that; not complicated and stick to what is good. Sides range from cole slaw, beans, mac-n-cheese, cornbread, collards. I ordered the brisket platter which comes with cole slaw, either beans or collards, and a slice of cornbread. It was a healthy platter, when I like something I can put it down but I was full by the end. With a drink, my total was $11 which isn't too shabby for Comcast dining.

I asked the owner for a certain bottle, he responded in such a curt, trite manner.

I joined my friends in the up stairs tasting room and felt I was in some granny's attic. I bare light bulb stuck on a wall glaring in your eye, dark wood old chairs and table that look like they were gotten at a garage sale (and not the cool, old antique or shabby chic style) and a hodge podge of things they were selling and a nice sized opening in the wall with a great view of a very messy office.

pxyDwiiF_9Ium2AN3_lriA,IaX73WNkQtspGsF3Xwgm8w,OfUF725s1RaoaEOPY3hwZg,4,0,0,0,"So excited that Poke Bros is now in North Wilmington! We have visited a few times since its grand opening and anticipate it will be a regular feature in our takeout rotation. 

They offer several pre-designed poke bowls (BF really likes the Hula, featuring shrimp!), but I like the freedom of designing my own. On my first visit, I designed a bowl with a brown-rice base with salmon and spicy tuna on top, which was delicious but dry, leaving me a bit underwhelmed and disappointed. On subsequent visits, I realized my mistake: leaving out the OG sauce (a soy sauce-like liquid that adds both flavor and moisture) --- I wish the staff would have asked if I wanted to add it the first time because it's a game-changer!

My go-to bowl starts with a mix of sushi rice and brown rice (you can do a 50-50 split of base, options including white rice, brown rice, sushi rice, and mixed greens --- I def recommend at least partial sushi rice for flavor). I then add cucumber, edamame, avocado ($1 extra), masago, crabstick ($1 extra), green onion, with salmon as my main protein (sometimes a 50-50 salmon/tuna mix). I finish with a mix of Sriracha mayo, Coconut Ginger sauce (and, of course, OG sauce), and tempura crunchies. I love that I get to enjoy all the flavors of sushi with significantly less cost (and probably more food). 

They offer a tofu option for the vegetarians among us, and chicken for those who just don't do seafood.

As several reviews have stated, the service is slow at times and they typically have one person follow you through the entirety of the encounter, which may not be the most efficient way to handle things. I also think it might help if the servers suggest toppings so that patrons say yes/no and don't miss any ingredients (I have definitely forgotten to ask for ingredients and been sad when I got home with my bowl!). 

Other FYIs: There is online ordering, though I haven't tried it and can't speak to its success yet. They also offer a loyalty program where they hole-punch a card and offer free bowls after a certain number of punches.

The Natchez docks right across the street so you hear the horns and music all through out the day. It was the perfect location for the Halloween parade which goes right past the hotel. Perfect location for that. 

I've stayed here several times over the past two decades. After a really bad experience, I swore that I would never be back... but years passed... and I went back. The affordable price sucked me back in. They remodeled and changed things up quite a bit since my last visit. It really is beautiful. I was impressed. Until I took a closer look. There were red stains ALL OVER THE SHOWER. I called up housekeeping. was it blood? what was it? I think we figured out it was probably Hurricane juice had been splashed around. Did they work on cleaning it? Heck no, so I took pics to show everyone. This was also paying full price during Halloween weekend 2013 for my husband's 50th birthday adventure. Why didn't I learn? But then again, Location, Location Location... the Halloween parade was right outside our door. 

Ugh... and I still am traumatized about the time before this one that I stayed... it was a room up front on the second floor which was above a restaurant that is no longer there now. They came up to my room thinking my bathtub was over running but it wasn't, just stopped up... and it stayed stopped up the whole time I was there, never was fixed, never apology, never a discount... which also meant that we weren't able to clean ourselves. How is that acceptable?  This was before Yelp, many years ago. Same hotel company still owns it.  

On another trip tho, it was more of an anniversary trip in ""off season"" Dec... we checked in and were upgraded to the King Suite, top floor overlooking the Mississippi River. That was our best stay. Actually, I think the four of five times that I've stayed here, my room always faced the river so I think I've been pretty darn lucky. That's a huge plus if you don't mind the traffic and noise of Decatur. Oh and the music of the Steamboat Natchez throughout the day. A balcony would have made it sooo much sweeter... but the view of the parking lot and river is easy to deal with. Who's hanging in the room anyways.

For the majority of my time I work from home (yay!). But sitting on the couch/kitchen table just was not conducive to the space I now had (boo?). Since I am without kids for now, I had a bedroom with big windows, a window seat, wonderful light, and fantastic views to use as an office. I have a fancy printer, briefcase, diplomas, fancy rug, and all other sort of office things. I just needed a big ol' desk and a modern, ergonomic chair.

First stop was Office Depot on/in West End. The manager, Mindy, took great care of me and I found both the heavy, austere, dark wood desk I wanted as well as the modern ergonomic chair I needed to make sure my Mr. Burns-like posture was held at bay for as long as possible. Thing is, this stuff is big, heavy and comes in pieces. What to do? Delivery and assembly.

The delivery part of the tale was a nightmare. Courier Express was a complete disaster: late, argumentative, disagreeable, and threw my heavy boxes into my (open) doorway and kept it moving. The whole point of delivery was having them deliver to where I needed the furniture set up. Didn't happen. Phone calls to their office/warehouse was about as effective as the Cubs in September.* Vowing a fatwa, I managed to figure out a way to carry the crazy heavy pieces through the ground floor, up the stairs and to my office. And then I waited for assembly. I was a bit scared.

I shouldn't have been. My guy was on time, polite, came with all his tools, and was ready to get to work. I posted up downstairs and let him have at it. In no time at all, I had an office chair that suited me to a tee (I'm sitting in it now). It seems like a small thing but it was so gratifying to finally have. Then came time for leviathan. This desk was no joke but as I listened to hammering, drills and the like, before I knew it, I had a large, stately desk that is going to serve me well for many years to come. I was extremely impressed with the speed with which he worked. I offered water but he had his own. This guy was good. AND, he put all the mess back in the boxes which significantly cut down on my clean up. I would use ARS again and again for my big furniture assembly projects. Why do it yourself when you can pay a pro to do it better than you could?

She was training in Deptford for a new job, and the company put her and several other trainees up at the Fairfield Inn. Renovation was taking place in parts of the hotel. As other reviews have stated, there was an unpleasant odor of mold. My daughter cut her foot the first night on a broken off piece of metal from the base of the bed in the room. The hotel sent someone up to file off the sharp piece after she reported it.  Luckily, her tetanus shot is current.  Another evening, she came back to the hotel from training and went into the bathroom, almost falling due to water covering the floor. Apparently, several other rooms were also flooded.  She reported this, and was moved to another room.  In the meantime, a fellow trainee was bitten by bed bugs in her hotel room, which caused an allergic reaction, sending her to the ER (on her birthday, no less).  She took a picture of one of the bed bugs. The hotel allowed the woman to stay an extra night free of charge in order to treat her clothing/belongings so she wouldn't take the bed bugs back to her home on Thursday. My daughter called me in tears Thursday morning.  Her husband had stayed with her the previous night and discovered bites all over his body when he returned home to Philadelphia that morning. My daughter was panicking that her suitcase might be infested, and could do nothing about it as she needed to be in training all day.  I called Nisha, the manager at the Fairfield Inn, and asked that something be done; e.g. send someone to my daughter's nearby training site to pick up her suitcase and inspect the contents then treat them if infested.  At first, Nisha said there was not a bed bug problem at the hotel.  When she found out that I knew about the trainee that had gone to the ER due to bed bug bites, she said she could not discuss that. Nisha said there was nothing they could do about my daughter's possible infestation. She said she and another hotel employee had gone through my daughter's hotel room (Room 123) and not seen evidence of bed bugs. Since she had been less than honest about the bed bug problem, I had little faith in her word. I ended up having to drive from Philadelphia to the training site and going through my daughter's suitcase in the parking lot. It was hard to ascertain if there was an infestation as most of my daughter's clothes were black, so I piled everything in a large black trash bag.  When I took my daughter home, we washed and dried everything on high heat that we could.  Now we must just wait and see if her house is infested as a result of her stay at the Fairfield Inn. I called the Marriott corporate office and filed a complaint. I would NEVER stay at this hotel. Obviously, from the last few years of bad reviews, they are still not seriously addressing important health and safety issues that affect their customers.",2018-11-03 14:32:17,négatif,négatif

Although the restaurant is centered around their Waygu beef in all varieties and preparations (even in the form of sushi), they have options for vegans!

The seafood medley consisted of shrimp, mussels, clams, cod fish, and lobster tails. The vegetable medley consisted of romaine lettuce, spinach, baby bok choy.

I gave Sue a general idea of what I was looking for in terms of design & color for the cake. She quickly drew up a sketch just several hours later, and we were in business. She provided great ideas when I didn't know what I wanted, and took it upon herself to look up the event website to match the cake colors with the event's branding -- huge help. 

I ordered a 4 tiered cake as well as additional sheet cakes: chocolate, vanilla, and red velvet.

Go for the great food, cocktails, and wine - it's a fantastic place that takes pride in everything (other than the service at times) and you'll enjoy whatever you get.",2012-01-21 21:52:29,positif,positif

Upon arrival, we were instantly greeted and were advised that we could sit ourselves. Our waitress was very down to earth, and gave many recommendations including their specialty,  ""the French Bread Hamburger""...of course this was what I ordered (w/fries), along with the cup of chili. 
For an appetizer we had the cheesesticks, which were really good. Grade A mozzarella fried to golden perfection, and served fresh out of the fryer! So cheesy and flavorful! I got mine served with ranch dressing, which just added to the greatness. 
I then received my burger and chili, and boy was it on. I can honestly say that this burger was really far better than I anticipated! The French bread was toasted and buttery, so it had that soft crunchy outside, but a warm chewy inside. The burger was VERY well seasoned, and I was surprised at all the flavor and juiciness of it! 
Now let me tell you about my absolute favorite part of the dinner was the chili!! This was the BEST chili I'd ever had! (Next to Ma's, and it's a close 2nd. ..don't tell Ma!). The flavor was spot on with saltiness and spice! My favorite part was the big chunks of perfectly seasoned ground beef! The bean to meat ratio was sheer perfection! Add the shaved cheese and ranch dressing, and I was in dinner heaven! 
This was a really great experience, and the only down side was one of the waitresses  although so sweet, was a little too chatty. ..and the owner wasn't the friendliest  (but it could've been a long night!)

Well, THE VERY SAME MANAGER that I had issues with, LAWANDA RAINEY AKA ZEE answered the phone and LIED and stated that she had NEVER heard of my friend nor had anyone by her name EVER worked there and suggested that the check cashing place call the police (1754 South Hanley Rd) even though ZEE physically gave my friend her paycheck at 11:15AM on Friday morning. Well because of Zee lying, the police was called on my friend - When the police arrived, they called the store and LAWANDA RAINEY AKA ZEE (the lady with the meth teeth) repeated the same LIE to the police BUT the police who arrived had previously worked at THIS DUNKIN DONUTS and was well aware of the foolishness that goes on at THIS LOCATION. One of the officers contacted his sister, who is a district manager and SHE WAS ABLE TO VERIFY MY FRIENDS EMPLOYMENT AT THE DUNKIN LOCATED AT 1754 SOUTH HANLEY RD! THE POINT OF THIS UPDATED REVIEW IS TO WARN FOLKS THAT LAWANDA RAINEY AKA ZEE, THE STORE MANAGER WILL NOT ONLY BE RUDE TO THE CUSTOMERS BUT WILL LIE AND WEAPONIZE THE POLICE AGAINST THE EMPLOYEES SHE APPARENTLY HAS ISSUES WITH!! THIS STORE DEFINITELY NEEDS BETTER LEADERSHIP BC THIS WOMAN LAWANDA RAINEY AKA ZEE IS A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY! If she's willing to go as far as LYING TO THE POLICE on an employee, what makes you as a customer trust that she's not doing foul things to your food or drinks?

1. Unacceptably understaffed. One lady mans the front desk, and shares her one nighttime staff member or handyman with the neighboring hotel during frequent emergencies.
2. Facilities in massive disrepair. They will tell you it is currently being renovated, so listen to them and stay away until they are *absolutely finished* with renovations, whenever that is. Heaters rattle loudly or are broken in some rooms. If something is broken, and a maintenance guy comes, he may leave without cleaning up the mess behind him. Doors will not close/lock easily or automatically in many rooms due to unprofessionally reapplied door paint. Curtains are worn down with unexplained holes. Leaking hallway ceiling. Some faucets jut out from the wall.
3. Incomplete cleanings between guests and hastily applied bedding. I may just be lucky but I have never stayed in a hotel where the staff repeatedly fails to clean a room completely or properly put the fitted sheet onto the mattress.

My opinion if you can't do nails without relying on the drill then you just can't do nails period.
I am Deaf, and I told them just as much. So it becomes frustrating when they keep trying to communicate with masks on. Well I sat down for my manicure and she whipped out the drill. I started shaking my head indicating that I do not want the drill. She kept trying to insist on it. I let her know those make my nail beds hurt for weeks, I don't do drills. Another lady came over and kept talking to me, I shook my head letting her know I couldn't hear nor understand her. She got an attitude and yanked her mask down and said ""no drill no dip"" I said wow ok got up and indicated that I wanted to pay for my pedicure. 
The manager was then summoned and she came to me and mentioned about her doing my manicure instead. I said no thank you I didn't like your employee's attitude I wanted to pay for my pedicure and leave.

Veggies were well prepared, just a bit al dente ... exactly how we like them.

Bread pudding was good. Lots of sauce which we proceed to dribble all over the table. Oops.

Jess V stated ""I really do appreciate the location of Distrito seeing as though I usually have to cross the bridge into Philadelphia for some good food."" 

South Jersey is home to many great dining establishments, but no matter where you live, there is nothing like dining in the city because it provides an individual with so many options. Prior to my initial visit to Distrito I made the trip to Bueno Odena in Philadelphia for their tacos. I even made the trip one Saturday so that the wife could try their tacos. When the opportunity to dine at Distrito was finally afforded to me, my thought process mirrored Jess V's statement. 


The tacos at Distrito are prepared, presented, and taste very good. The tacos are packed... with delicious ingredients, and flavor. Every ingredient in the taco contributes to the fiesta of goodness mingling with my taste buds. The tacos, especially the fish tacos, are some of the best. No longer do I have to cross the bridge for good food...tacos at least. 
I know, I am going on and on about these tacos, but there are plenty of items that will satisfy your Mexican craving. Be it their skirt steak, ceviche, or fajitas, there are plenty of items on the menu. 


There is no bad time to dine at Distrito but Happy Hour, which is from 4-7 everyday is one of the best times. $5 Margaritas, $4 Beers, and $5 for two tacos, sounds like three hours of sheer happiness to me.",2015-08-10 02:37:05,positif,positif

First, the ambiance.  The restaurant has a sleek, modern feel to it and appeared very clean and comfortable.  A solo guitarist playing Spanish-styled instrumentals set the mood ~ not too loud, not too quiet, just right.  I was there with a friend, but there were several couples and it would make a great place to have a date night.

We arrived around 6:30 pm and they have happy hour from 4-7 pm with $4 sangria and my friend had the red and I had the white.  They were both very good, so I would get there before 7 pm, if possible.  They had other happy hour specials too, but I can't remember what they were. 

Now the food...  We started with the ""tapas tasting"" off the entree menu to share.  We asked our server, Dillon, for some suggestions and it must have been kismet because he recommended three of the four things we had discussed when reviewing the menu on the way to the restaurant.  His recommendations were spot on.

We got the Pulpo a la Gallega, the Filete de Res and the Paella Valenciana.  The Pulpo a la Gallega was fantastic.  I love octopus when it is cooked correctly and can't stand it when it is not.  The octopus was cooked absolutely perfectly and the olive oil, garlic and paprika were ideally balanced to showcase the flavor rather than detract from it. The Filete de Res was also a perfectly balanced concoction of beef tenderloin, mushrooms and a sherry wine flambe.  Sublime!  The paella was also incredible with a good proportional mixture of ingredients. 

At this point, we were getting pretty full, so we just decided to order a couple more tapas and walk off our meal on the way to the game.  This time we got the Champiñones Extravaganza and the Empanadas de Carne.  The sauce on the mushrooms was absolutely sinful.  it was extremely rich and very filling, but we just couldn't tear ourselves away from the plate.  The empanadas were also superb, with a perfect beef mixture inside.

I will try to add photos later.
This is by far THE WORST Extended stay I have ever seen.
On the back side of the building the area near the stairs is filthy. No one has washed it down ever and the trash cans are right there so lots of evidence of spilling etc. gum removal stains all over the place. It is worse than a Wallly world parking lot.
Every day there are smokers sitting under the no smoking sign or smoking on the deck in front of doors next to non smoking rooms.

There here have been cigarette butts all over the place.  Many right around the trash cans where people smoke and staff does nothing about it.

Garbage in the parking lot and grounds. I have been here for three weeks. My wife is now in town and we will move to a different place.

The door doesn't fit the jam correctly and you can see outside from the inside near the bottom of door.
The doorway threshold looks as if it has never been cleaned..filthy!!
There is very little counter space in the bathroom
The shower curtain is mounted so high that it barely covers the edge of the tub.
There were bugs in it that I had to spray for.
The toilet was so brown in the bottom and under the rim that I told the house keeper about it.  Bless her hearts but she said that it wasn't my day. after my cleaning day came up all that was done was the linens were replaced.  She missed the dish towel.
The kitchen floor was not cleaned, like maybe ever!!!!. I was wondering why the shower got so dirty and I looked at my feet from being there barefoot(in the room only) so I took a wet paper towel to the floor and it was black. I bought some scrubbing bubbles and a cheap toilet brush and some cleanser. I had to clean the toilet and guess what...all the brown stains in the bottom of bowl are now gone. I have never in my life seen toilet in any hotel 3rd world included that was this bad.

Today (the 2nd day my wife has been here...some crackhead girl on a chopper bicycle with some sort of dinky gas motor...was yelling at someone in the morning there that they better pay her for what they got.

The shower/tub is small and it is stained with hard water deposits that are never cleaned. The floor wasn't cleaned. The bottom of the shower/tub floor is so warn that the fiberglass color is starting to show through.
Now come the fresh towels..Two were white and two were worn out dingy grayish white, I use better and cleaner rags to clean my Harley!!  I could have over looked the very old and dated kitchen b ut the filth and piss poor management of this place is unacceptable. I will be getting out this week.

They also have long term contracts with construction companies that have their employees that stay there comeing in drunk, smoking weed in the rooms and being very noisy. The staff does little.
Under know condition should the manager there be employed anywhere!!
Then comes the laundry room...the dryers are so worn that the finish is gone on the metal drums. Most worked..no matter what setting you had them on everything was high temp. Not very clean but that is par for this place.  Seriously this is the dirtiest franchise or non hotel I have seen in my life and I travel all over the world.

This place is great for accommodating a large group.  We originally had 10 people and added 2 more at the last minute with no problem, on a Saturday night.  

The food  - this is the part that I wanted to like more.  I started off with the plantains. I love plantains and I like to try them everywhere I go.  These were....ok.....good, but not spectacular.  They were fried but not crispy and were covered in cheese, but it wasn't melted.  If you're looking for the best plantains, check out Dos Segundos.  Next I ordered an arepa with cheese and black beans.  I've had arepas in the past and this was not my favorite.  It was kind of dry and not very flavorful.  There wasn't enough cheese and the cheese that was on there wasn't melty enough.  They look small but they are deceptively filling, so I'm glad that's all I ordered.

The prices seem slightly high for the area and also for the food that you get.  I think the plantains were around $7 for a few small pieces.  

The service was great.  Very prompt and warm and friendly.  I sampled the desserts of my dining companions and they were outstanding.  This is where Sazon shines - hot chocolate and dessert.  It's BYOB too - always a plus.

They have a special as well that is a german styled pizza with bacon and onion that is heavenly.  They have great specials and even participate in the mardigras king cake ideal with pretzel as opposed to cake, and its killer.  You can get smallish snacks here, pretzels, and sausages on a stick.    The owner is always friendly and participates with his business associates and clientele.   Also participates in the various mardigras krewes, and art markets making the business accessible to the parade community, and community in general.

Please do not hesitate to enjoy to the max! Just in from the beach, no worries, this place is SBSC Santa Barbara Super-very-Casual and gets real busy at times... 

At the Empty Bowl they have the secret glue that keeps the place together some how. Lots of the restaurants, in the SBPM come and go, go, gonesville. Empty Restaurant cYaL8R... must be very challenging to operate in.

However with the Empty Bowl I say they have a giant anchor in their Big Bad Bowl holding down the center piece of eating extravaganzas, some are very popular and jam packed serving up just the right recipes!  (Hint see other Yelp Reviews)

At times the wonderful Taco Team guys next door (Corazon Cocina) are packing them in, You don't have to wait, you can quickly grab an empty seat at the Empty Bowl counter, and at times they will get you started straight away. The counter will be empty in one minute and the next it is jammed and buzzing with happy eaters and maybe a few noodlers as well. 

Recently we were a party of four at the Empty Bowl, three orders were perfect, one order was to be all veggie and they accidentally snuck in some natural free range, gourmet, slow roasted, lovely tasting well seasoned chicken. Oops, they quickly made it right for my buddy  and he stated is was perfect. No cluck for that buck! They were very apologetic for the menu order mixup.

Either is unacceptable for an employee at McDonald's where one is likely to receive better customer service than I did here. 

I ordered two iced coffees with a splash of coconut. I received two iced coffees that were one fourth coconut and so sweet that I physically could not swallow the product. It was pure syrup.

These reasons drove me to the Belgian Cafe one night last week. I've been here before, but only for drinks. I really like this spot, because it has outdoor seating, a nice bar, an open area if it gets crowded, and a nice seating area. Inside and out, it looks better than your average everyday restaurant. While atmosphere doesn't seem to add a lot, it's nice to sit in a comfortable area. Throughout the meal, our server seemed to leave us without beer for longer than I would have liked, but this is my only complaint. He was really knowledgeable about beer, and that makes up any small error in serving.

Looking at the beer list and menu, it's no surprise that this restaurant is a Tom Peters venture. The beer list is excellent, with a couple of Belgians on tap at $7 a glass, and a great selection from around the rest of the world and country. A taplist is available online, and although it's slightly outdated because they change beer quickly, it still can give you a good idea. I stayed domestic for the night with the Avery White Rascal (I'm really into Avery lately) and the Anchor Liberty Ale. I was dining with Rachel for the evening, and she was enjoying the Duchesse De Bourgogne. If you can't find something on tap you like, you're: A) likely crazy, and B) not going to be let down by the bottle list. Beer is easily the forte of the whole establishment (as it should be).

The menu leaves something to be desired. To be clear, the menu is not bad. But it seems like the exact same thing as Monk's, and if that's what I wanted, I would just go there. The Belgian Cafe serves up burgers, mussels, and larger entree dishes. After deliberation, we ordered a large pot of mussels in a sauce of of jalapeno pepper butter, cilantro, orange zest, and belgian wit ale. They were solid, and good, but not amazing. Still, it's a really nice dish to share, and comes with a (obligatory) order of tasty fries.

Bottom Line: It seems that my standards are getting too high. Where I would normally rave about this spot, I'm now inclined to tell you to walk up the block if you're in fairmount, or tell you to hit up Monk's if your craving the best Belgian spot around. Don't get me wrong, this is a good solid eatery. I think I'd just rather hit it up in passing as opposed to making it the main event for the evening. And if every spot seems to be crowded in the neighborhood, the Belgian Cafe still has room for you and your friends.",2009-07-14 14:47:44,positif,neutre

I ordered it hot spicy (I'm pregnant so I'm more sensitive to spicy food right now but I'll update in a couple months when I can go back and test out their Thai spicy) and it was honestly the perfect amount of spicy, even without being pregnant. It made my nose run, but I could still taste all of the complexity in the flavors.

First...this is a ""pet friendly"" hotel and apparently one of the few in the area so there were a lot of dogs. I have no issues with dogs, however, I do with them inside the pool area where you may doze off at the pool and they start barking. OR at the breakfast tables while you're trying to eat as dogs are staring, whining and barking at you. Those two areas should be off limits! Housekeeping does a great job of cleaning but if you have allergies, you may have a reaction. 
The hotel is on a busy road. It is loud. I could not hear anything from inside our but the road runs next to the pool. And while they did their best with a large water feature to drown out the noise, the road is louder and then add the barking dogs were the added noise. So not a relaxing feel at the pool. 
The hotel is near every restaurant and store you may need. The kitchen in the room is perfect for having cold foods or snacks on hands, or microwave some popcorn, without having to run out all the time.

On top of all this there was pork and chicken in their packages that were bloated and full of air. What's worse is that I'm sure they will use all this meat to make ground beef.

There's no question the food here is delicious, I was nothing but happy with the items I ordered. Though on both occasions that I started my day at this bakery, the server (the same woman both days, with pink hair) treated me like an incompetent idiot. I can understand a one-off bad day, or if the questions I'd asked her had been particularly dumb, but both times my questions were harmless. On the first day, I asked what was in the chickpea salad, because it looked delicious. She rolled her eyes and said 'It's chickpeas.', as if I wasn't asking for an expansion of what was written on the label. The second time I went, I ordered a latte and paid with a card. She was obviously very busy and I got the (perhaps false) impression that she had forgotten to return my card. When she passed me the latte and I asked, just to be sure, 'Sorry, can I just get my card back?' she once again looked at me with disdain and in a condescending tone said 'Yeah, of course, I'm doing that right now.' I don't know if I caught this woman on two particularly off days or if she always treats the customers this way, but it is certainly not how I want to start my mornings off.

We got there before 10am on a Saturday and only had to wait about 10 minutes. I can imagine the wait only increases from there.

My boyfriend ordered the Crabby Dick, which is 100% a must-try. The amount of crab you get is incredibly generous - the whole dish is phenomenal. 

I was going to order the Huevos Ahogados, but our wonderful server offered some advice that led me to opt for the Hawthorne's Omelet instead. The filling of the omelet (braised short rib, caramelized onion, sharp cheddar) is an unusual omelet combination, but one I will remember for a long time. The short rib was tender, juicy, and had a ton of flavor. I was thrilled with my omelet, but the Crabby Dick won me over and I will get that next time.

I loved the crispy homefries, BF didn't care for them as much.

1.  Despite the high def TV setup with 20 TVs, they will not under any circumstances change the TV channel for you.  For example NFL playoffs are on CBS, or a Nevada Wolfpack game (duh the campus is next door and many of your customers GO TO UNR!!!!?????) and staff refuses to change channels from PBS Antique Roadshow or some obscure movie on Syfy channel both showing on MULTIPLE TV'S (Yes they set multiple TVs to TV no one would ever watch then refuse to change it).  So, plan your superbowl workout somewhere else!

     In the black card area they set the TV to Nickelodeon for days so it was showing cartoons to people paying extra to use the area.  REALLY?  The channel in that area changes from time to time but per management (Luke) you cannot request it or any of the TVs to be changed.  This policy is so braindead and just screams corporate ignorance and our rules are more important than our customers.  It's so lazy to not tune in to Nevada Wolfpack and NFL playoffs something your customers would love!!!!

2.  I've never seen any rules enforced.  And if they don't have one for cell phone use WHILE LIFTING they definitely need it.  Saw a guy doing pulldowns with one hand and talking on his phone with the other hand for 5-6 sets and no one does anything.  People everywhere just sitting on machines on their phones.
 
 Also, I've seen multiple people sweating and using the massage equipment then fail to sterilize/wipe off the machines.  

3.  Equipment is often down.  One of the hydro-massage chairs has been down multiple times and one of the employees without me even asking said yeah that chair (1 of 2) seems to be down more than it's not.  Last time i used a treadmill the first 3 were down.

4.  Volume of music is often times way too loud.  Many people ( I would guess half?) wear headphones to try and drown out the sound of the mostly Top 40 (strange mix of music played).  People aren't liking the music you're playing...at least turn it down please?  I have to crank my headphones to not hear their music.

5.  Constant infomercials constantly played on their TVs which are at slightly lower level than the TVs you're trying to watch so it's super distracting.  These TVs constantly remind your your smile is not perfect and you should pay money to fix it.  How does this go with the ""no critics"" and ""no judgement"" mottos????  

Finally....management.   Don't leave your business cards for people to contact you if you don't plan to respond to them.  It's embarrassing!  Took multiple emails to get next to no response saying there was nothing they can do about TV's because of corporate.  Asked for a contact at corporate and ZERO response.

We usually need food to soak up the booze and at 3:00 in the morning that can be a challenge if you don't know where to go.  The great thing about Denny's is that they are actually opened 24 hours a day!  This is great for all the wasted people in Edmonton.  But you need to tell your Designated Driver to get there before all the other DD's otherwise you will need to wait for a table.  The other great thing about Denny's is you can order breakfast any time of the day, even for dinner if you want!  I love that!  The service is fast and friendly and the prices are pretty sweet considering the amount of food they bring out to you.  You end up feeling like a pig for actually consuming most of the stuff they put in front of you.  But it is all just so yummy that you can't stop packing it in.  If you happen to be drunk we usually tell ourselves that all this food is required to soak up all that booze we consumed.  

Now if you are going to Denny's for breakfast then I suggest one of the following dishes: If you are too hungry for words and love the meat then order the Lumberjack Slam.  If you like omelettes then order the Ultimate Omelette.  The Fabulous French Toast Platter is mighty good if you like your French Toast.  The Pancakes are famous here so defiantly try those.  I like the Heartland Scramble (it comes with the country-fried potatoes... so good).

If you want to order lunch then the Club Sandwich and the Chicken Sandwich is really good.

Unfortunately, our experience was marred by very poor customer service.  My best friend ordered the egg and avocado on toast without the toast because she is allergic to gluten.  She asked if some additional vegetables could be added to her meal and was told sternly ""No.""  

When her food arrived, it had Parmesan cheese on it which was also problematic because she is allergic to cow cheese.  She told the gal who brought it out that she couldn't eat it because of the cheese.  The lady sighed and said ""You have to tell them at the front because otherwise they don't know.""  (There was no reference on the menu about cheese.)  

We didn't receive napkins with our food so I wandered inside to find some.  I didn't see any and asked the you-can't-add-vegetables lady where to find napkins.  She said ""There are napkins on every table.""  I pointed to our patio table that had literally nothing on it except our plates.  

""Oh, I guess you don't have any.""

I made reservations online, and noted it was my boyfriends birthday. Upon arrival, we were greeted and immediately taken to our table where they had placed 3 birthday balloons for my boyfriend. We had 3 different servers taking care of us the duration of our meal, and they were all fabulous! 

Everything was going great until we got the menus. Now, we've eaten at a fancy place or two, but we had no idea what anything on the menu was (besides the steak). 

We said, ""what the hell?"" and just ordered the Creole Crawfish Gnocchi (because it stated there was cream cheese somewhere on or in it)  When they brought out our appetizer, it was NOTHING like we had imagined. It looked like it had a mini crab on top (I had never seen a crawfish before). We gave it a try and it was so effin good! So flavorful! We literally left nothing on the plate. 

My boyfriend and I ordered the Filet Mignon of Black Angus Beef. My sister, although skeptical of the dishes on the menu, ordered the Pecan Crusted Gulf Fish. We asked the waitress about the Pecan Crusted Fish and if it was sweet, because the menu said it had crushed corn cream, and we weren't sure if that would be good or not. 

HOLY CRAP! When I took my first bite of my medium rare steak I couldn't believe how tender it was, it was literally melting in my mouth. I asked my sister for a bite of her Pecan Crusted Gulf Fish, and I was literally ok with the idea of dying at that moment. That is the best dish I have ever eaten in my entire life! The crushed cream corn sauce was not sweet at all, it was so buttery and delicious. 

I don't know how these chefs cook dishes that are so beyond amazing, tender, and flavorful, but they did a bitchin job! 

The owner came up to us, introduced himself, wished my boyfriend a happy birthday, and thanked us for coming to his family's restaurant. 

At the end of dinner, we declined dessert, but they brought us a birthday ice cream for the bday boy anyways.

First, it's connected to the Astor Crown hotel and it seems as though it is part of the hotel...wrong! If you try to enter the restaurant from the hotel they tell you to walk towards the front where the hostess stand. It's so uncomfortable walking through all these people to get to the hostess stand only to be turned around and walked through again when your table is available.
So there is your waiter and then there is your drink person. Try to keep up with who is who. So in the beginning I had ordered ceviche but realized I wasn't that hungry and decided to share a plate with my sister. So we're sitting there and then our food comes out. So the ceviche came out even though I cancelled that order. When telling the waitress, she dozed off for a little and then said she didn't hear that I no longer wanted the ceviche anymore. She then says ""do you want me to take it back?"" To some this may seem weird but to me, when a waiter messes up your order and they bring the wrong food out they apologize and tell you they'll take it off. They thank you for informing them of their mistake. However, she took the food back. The germaphobe in me wanted to know what she was gonna do with that plate. I hope she didn't serve it to the next person that ordered it. Never in my life have I had ""mistake"" food taken back. 
When I got my correct food, it was drenched in Cajun seasoning. It was almost to overbearing to eat with the 5 jumbo shrimp I was given. The only good thing is when you order a platter they separate it on 2 plates.

I like the price and serving size, $2, and 3 oz. of meat per taco (the fish taco is $3) is a great deal.  The ""Jamaican"" was delicious. I'd give the Chef 4.5 stars if every taco I tried were as flavorful as this option.  The plantain chips gave it the perfect crunch and the mango sauce in combination with the coconut flakes gave this taco a delicious flavor.  

The remaining two tacos lacked flavor.  The teriyaki sauce on the ""Japanese"" was waaaaay too strong (Costco prepackaged variety?), and yet the meat lacked any flavor at all.  Rather than aiding the bland meat, the sauce overwhelmed any other flavor with sugary syrup.  The pineapple chunk was huge, but I enjoyed the broccoli slaw on top.  The ""Sonoran"" was just forgettable.  Bland meat, no spice, yeah, this was an underwhelming selection that could not even be redeemed by the delicious Anita Street tortilla foundation.

The only complaint I had was the service was kinda slow and they kept bringing our food out one at a time. I had ordered pork tamales and it was only one small tamale that they brought on a plate by itself before our food came. It was so small and totally not worth the price. Very disappointing.

I was so happy to hear they've got a meat free 100% plant based option now so I had to go check them out. The taco is more expensive than the regular beef ones but I'm guessing the price might come down if/when the fine folks at Beyond Meat expand. 

That said the taco was DELICIOUS! It's got the prefect amount of sauce/spices. Apparently they're cooked separately from the meat so no worries there. If you're a meat eater I'd suggest you give it a try as I'm not sure you'd be able to tell the difference and if you're a veggie, it's always nice to have more options so give it a try!

According to their website you can sub out the Beyond Meat for any of their meat options so I might do that next time.

A bit about the location, it's clean and there's plenty of room. The employees are kind of a bit meh about being there but they're polite and quick.

Even the 15 year old with loved her meal! I had catfish with broccoli accompaniments. Wow! Words cannot do justice. We dined on the patio. Beautiful! An awning provided shade until dusk. What a lovely experience.
I would love to give a 5, but I have to take away a bit for ambience. About 15 minutes before we left (thankfully it took that long) a party with three (totally age-inappropriate) young children was seated right next to us. I seriously mourn the days when it was the standard in American society to acknowledge the concept of age-appropriateness...on the part of parents and restaurant management. Also, as we were leaving, I noticed the upstairs dining rooms were very loud. Each had tables with small children, and some with just simply loud adults. The last time we dined here, we were in an upstairs dining room and the noise level was quite loud, as opposed to the times we have dined downstairs at the tables with a view of the garden. For me the experience was devalued by the noise.
I love this restaurant, and without reservation recommend the food, but if you care about a pleasant, sophisticated, quiet experience, you need to take certain measures to perhaps enhance your chances of acheiving the desired atmosphere. I would suggest perhaps requesting downstairs dining and adding that you value a pleasant ambience.
I am all for a movement demanding restauranteurs start again respecting the sensibilities of those who want excellent food AND ambience for their dining-out dollar.

We ordered Vegas roll, spicy tuna roll, spicy scallop / spicy tuna hand rolls and 7 piece of tuna sashimi. It totalled up to around $35 + tips.

The only thing we remembered about the rolls were its tiny size, the spicy tuna was not spicy and neither was the scallop. The scallop was kinda raw and it tasted like it was just defrosted.  The sashimi were cut wrongly and it did not taste fresh at all.

We got into line a little before 8 on a Sunday night, and we spent about a half hour in line, but that was the longest part of the process. The service was so quick and efficient that we waited maybe 10 minutes for our food.

The atmosphere was lively; we sat downstairs, but we could still hear the live band playing on the rooftop deck, which was a nice touch for those who wanted to keep away from the smoke pits upstairs. 

Now for the food. We ordered the Big Brother sampler to split, as neither of us were hungry enough for an entire order of anything, and the BF isn't much into barbeque anything. The Big Brother sampler comes with smoked brisket, ribs, and two sides (we had hushpuppies and mac & cheese). The sides were fantastic: there were seasoned breadcrumbs on the mac which added a great touch, and the hushpuppies were bomb. However, the brisket and ribs were just okay. The rub on the ribs was good, and the meat definitely fell off the bones, but it wasn't anything to write home about. The brisket was well smoked but beyond that didn't have much flavor. Each table comes with a huge bottle of Jack's BBQ sauce, which definitely boosted the flavor of the brisket.

Overall, I was hovering between a 3.5 or 4 out of 5, so I did the correct math thing and rounded up. If you're in town, give it a try.",2019-03-29 02:42:38,positif,positif

The hotel looks great; the complimentary valet parking and bell services are very efficient.
The check-in line was too long and slow for my opinion. Only 2 front desk stations were attended and waiting in the line after 4 hours driving with the kids was not pleasant.
The kid's play areas were great. A very nice play place next to an arcade area. We also tried the onsite bowling and it was great. My kids loved it. (Every activity cost). 
The room was another story. I often use hotels/inns for my business travels and expected little bit more from GSR. Basic things were missing here.
The room was very dark. Only two very low light table lamps were in the room. I used to lowlights in hotel rooms however this was too much.
The lack of light continue in the bathroom, there was a low light next to mirror and one head lamp that operated by timer that turn light off after the setting time (be careful not to set it too short before ending your shower :-) ) and it took 2-3 minutes to the bulb to warm up and give a reasonable light!!! So old fashion.
Cleanliness - There were used tissues, old pens and notes papers between beds and nightstand that was not cleaned during all our stay.  If talking about the nightstand there was only one night stand. I took 2 queen size beds in the room and the night stand was in the middle between the beds, so only one side of bed can use it. me and my wife wearing glasses so it was very inconvenient.
There were no cups in bathroom to wash mouth or stand the toothbrush.
No places to hang towels, only one small hook behind door that was hanging and about to fall from the door any moment. (the funny thing it says as other hotels I can keep towels for reuse if I won't put them on floor, I usually do that, however how should I dry them if there is no place to hang them?)
No Bar or refrigerator in room which is kind of standard in other places.
I would definitely think twice before coming back. I may give it another chance next time I get to Reno as my kids enjoyed it so much but I doubt it.",2016-11-28 22:15:57,négatif,neutre

It was the machine fault Matt, there was no way to get it. So then the manager just gave me the prize and then Matt walked away. I cleared the machine so I asked Matt again to refill the machine. He was groaning and obviously didn't care about it at all. I also asked him if he could put in a certain prize so I can try to get it. He ignored me, and I even pointed out to him what prize and he just didn't say anything. So I just played and I cleared the machine again.

I tired for the ones that were achievable, but he put the prize in such a way in fell down behind the prize grab area. So I was pissed so I left. The thing to take away from this is, don't let Matt help you with anything. If you see him, try and get someone else to help you. He is by far the worst person in Round 1, everyone else is so nice.

I honestly do feel as though the way I was treated had to do with the fact that I am 24 years old. But I paid Eric Krebs good money for the work done on my car, and realized that the level of service I received was unacceptable.

I took my car in to get fixed (had no idea what was wrong with it). It was a busy day, so I was told that my car would probably not be looked at until the end of the day and they would call me. Totally fine. Turns out my car needed a new battery. Easy fix and my car would be ready in  no time. They would call me when it was ready. 

Except I never got called. I waited a day and a half before calling and was finally told that they were having trouble finding my car battery and would be in touch when they found it.

Of course they never called me back. When I called, this time it was that the tube connecting the battery to my car was the wrong size. I did get ONE call though! This time they finally had all the correct parts and promised to be in touch once my car was ready to go. I called them two days later and they said my car was ready, but I had to hurry because they closed in less than an hour!

When I went inside to pay, I was presented with a bill that was around $50 more than I was quoted. I was told that this was for their ""time and effort"" looking for the tube! I didn't think that that was a mistake that I had to pay for, but rather than argue, I quickly paid my bill and left.

So I stopped in at the visitor's center, and the lady at the desk suggested their trolley tour.  Having done a similar tour in San Francisco and having really enjoyed it, I signed up.   As it's the off season, there was only one other person on the trolley with me, so we had the undivided attention of the tour guide, which would have been nice if he had actually had any real knowledge of the sights.  Instead he resorted to lame jokes and pointed out things like the 7-11, saying ""That was NOT here when the Constitution was written.""  I know it was an attempt to be funny, but it just fell flat.   

Since this is one of those tours where you can get off, do your thing, then get back on when it comes back around, we picked up a couple of other people along the way.  One woman was from Australia and had several questions, none of which he had an answer for.  At one point she even asked him ""Are you not going to give us any information about these places like the guy on the other bus did?""  He then said ""What do you want to know?""  Seriously?  He's paid to do this every single day, and he doesn't know what to tell the tourists?  Don't they have a script they're supposed to work from, or a test they have to pass to do this?  

On the plus side, the guide did make an excellent recommendation for a Philly cheesesteak, although he did tell me that he only gets them about once a year.

SO like I mentioned in my other review of another place sort of nearby... the broth is what makes pho PHO 

The broth!! 
This place has an amazing body of the soup, flavors just there and when you add the ""green onion oil"" nuac beo"" you bowl becomes complete!! Like I said before not for the faint who are watching their figures. 

Let's rewind... And go over 5 things 

Atmosphere 5/5 feels like a SJ hole in a wall
Distance to downtown 5/5 just the outskirts 
Cleanliness 3/5 
Food quality 5/5 
Staff friendliness 5/5

So I've ate here a handful of times and the pho broth has been very consistent! The noodles seem to be cooked perfect not over cooked and the typical pho dat biet is excellent. Last time I was here I tried their ox tail bowl and it was so tender!!!! Almost fall off the bone! 

What blows me away is the pricing! Super cheap compared to bay pricing usually ranging from 11-15 a bowl. This place is still sub 10 bucks!!! Insane!!! And the quality is there. That alone bumps up my rating. 

Location? It's in a off beat old strip mall. Definitely can drive by it and not know it's there!! But what I've learned is the hole in the wall areas are the best spots!!! And this stands true to my statement. 

I've tried their appetizers from fried chicken wings to spring roll and egg rolls all tasty and they come out in a fair amount of time. What makes a restaurant perfect is the timing of the bowls delivery to the table. They served our group of 10 at the same time and all the bowls look and seemed consistent in food temp and noodle texture. Everyone was talking and as soon as the food was served it became utter silence!  If you eat pho enough you know when your noodles are over cooked. Soggy and it can definitely ruin your noodle experience.

Well all that's being said it's safe to say that I'm a fan of this place and will come back when I'm in town and have the craving for pho! 

I'd recommend this spot if you are looking for a great bowl!!!",2021-10-29 04:02:48,positif,positif

We purchased a variety of braces and fan-rated junction boxes to have available for the install because we were replacing simple light fixtures and weren't sure what was up there. The installation seemed to go well and the installers told us the existing junction box was already fan-rated and, lucky us, we didn't need to do that extra work! We happily returned the supplies we had purchased. Unfortunately, we immediately had problems with one of the fans - a burning-type smell as well as a shaking/shuddering. I reached out to Rittenhouse Handyman and, to their credit, they promptly sent the guys back to look at it. They essentially told me the issues were due to the uneven ceilings in our 100-year-old rowhome and the fact that we bought lower-priced fans. Both of these things happened to be true, so I said thank you and they went on their way. However, we soon found out the burning smell was due to the fan being installed to a light switch with a dimmer, which if you aren't aware (which we weren't) is a bigtime no-no and fire hazard. Again, to be fair, I recognize these guys aren't electricians but I feel like they should have known this and pointed it out so we could remedy it with the proper contractor! Fortunately I caught the issue myself with a quick google search and we called an actual electrician and had the problem fixed right away. 
   As for the shuddering, we continued to chalk this up to their comment we had bought low-priced fans, so we finally bit the bullet and purchased 2 new, high end fans this week. We had the electrician come back out to install and to my dismay, he pointed out (and showed me) that the junction boxes were in fact NOT fan-rated and the ceiling fans could have fallen down at any time. This is especially alarming because one fan sat directly above my 3-month-old's play mat in her nursery. 
   I encourage Rittenhouse Handyman to be more attentive. Both the dimmer switches and junction box issues should have been on their radar and if they had felt that addressing these issues was outside their scope of service they never should have accepted the job.",2019-02-01 16:08:44,négatif,positif

First of all, they didn't have the game on television.  In fact, during the later part of the dinner rush, they didn't have any games on tv, just SportsCenter on every television set throughout the bar.  When I asked the bartender if she could put the game on, she seemed put off, as if changing the channel wasn't her job.  I waited approximately 15 minutes for her to figure out how to tune to TNT.
My second issue is that as I walked in, I noticed a sign advertising free mozzarella sticks if I wasn't offered a Corona or Margarita.  Of course, the bartender did not offer either a Corona or Margarita.  When I asked her about it, I was told that this promotion didn't work at the bar, as there were no signs at the bar, but there were signs at every table.  Seems like false advertising to me.  When I left, I looked at the sign again, and it did not state anything about having to sit at a table to be eligible.  As far as I'm concerned, Applebee's owes me mozzarella sticks.
That said, the beers were ice cold and very refreshing.  I ordered an Appetizer Sampler for food, which included boneless wings, spinach-artichoke dip with tortilla chips, mozzarella sticks, and some quesadillas.  All of which were quite tasty.  Also, the hostess was seemingly very nice.  She kept smiling and held the door for me both entering and leaving.

The pulled pork sandwich was fine, with a tender texture and somewhat flavorful meat, though it was more bland than I expected it to be.  The bread was a regular footlong, and the cost came out to $8.25 with tax.  That's decent.

Would I do it again?  No.  Not when Hershel's Deli is right across from Dinics, with almost no line, and with a heavenly pastrami sandwich.  And regardless of Hershel's, Dinic's sandwich is not worth waiting more than 10 minutes.  But, at least I can say I tried Dinics.

Speaking of that line, the reason the wait is so long has much more to do with the inefficiency of the workers versus the demand for the food.  They could fire half the staff and still have three people effectively chopping up the meat, putting it in the bun, and taking payment.",2011-04-19 15:20:32,neutre,négatif

Each time you would like to order, you fill out the sheet or else you will receive everything else right around the same time, even if you order a LOT of rolls for the table.  I had been lead to believe it would be staggered, though I will admit I may have just misunderstood.

I only really enjoyed two of the (again) MANY rolls that we tried.  They had many options with unique ingredients but I found that many tasted the same regardless of their contents.  Also, the menu is not clear on what is included with the AYCE.  The waitress didn't check in for long amounts of time and we had a very large waiting period between our two orders due to this.  My friend also requested a drink when he arrived and didn't get it until we reminded the waitress for a second time.

I'm unsure if this was a busy night with low staff or we just ended up with an unenthusiastic waitress but I'm not inclined to give this location a second chance. Not when there are multiple other sushi restaurants in the area offering the same AYCE deal.",2018-11-20 17:37:28,négatif,négatif

The first time I came here was with a large group as part of a ""meetup"" group. I arrived at our agreed upon time of 630 pm and we had made a reservation for 18 people far ahead of time. Being that the restaurant is quite small we were split into 2 different tables. From the outside it doesn't look too impressive as its a small place tucked in at the end of a strip plaza, but inside it is very nicely decorated with an array of artwork covering the walls. Very cozy feel, which is nice, considering you're likely to be here for a LONG time.

 I'm not sure if it was due to the large size of our group but everything took far longer than it should have. We got water right away but no drinks menus until we asked for them at least 15 minutes later. They do have an extensive wine and beer list with libations from around the world, presuming you can get anyone to come take your drink order before you decide to just give up on it. Another 45 minutes later of sitting there staring into space before someone takes our appetizer order. Yes, 45 minutes! 5 minutes after we finally get a bread basket for the table. By the time they took our order I was so starving I decided to get just an app rather than wait to order a whole entrée in order to avoid waiting longer. 

I chose the tostones with seasoned minced beef, onion and red bell pepper on top. Luckily after all that waiting my app did come out quickly along with the Ceviche that others at our table ordered for their app. Those who ordered meals were stuck waiting for another extensive period of time. Sadly I wasn't all that impressed with my tostones. The menu description should read ""large tostones cakes with tiny pieces of fatty beef on top, 1 sad little bell pepper slice and an ENTIRE large onion""  Seriously there was so much onion I could barely find my other food underneath. It was overkill. My first thought was that perhaps I just didn't order the ""right"" thing, and that's why I was disappointed, but then I thought ""shouldn't anything on on the menu be a ""right"" thing to order?!"" Meh. 

By this point I was over the whole experience and ready to get out of there. Due to the size of our group we were told they could only split our bill into 6 per table but I was able to flag down one of the servers, paid cash and skidaddled out of there.

Playa Azul is a Santa Barbara staple.  I can't remember when it wasn't around it has been so long!

They have a lot of the traditional combination plates like taco and enchilada with rice and beans or a chile relleno and burrito.   But they also have some wonderful stand alone dishes that would make anyone's mouth water.  

While I don't really think that they have the absolute best Mexican food in Santa Barbara they are certainly top tier.    While they don't have a salsa bar they do give you some very tasty salsa to go with your chips.

I love grocery shopping, period. However, shopping at H mart is more than just shopping for the sake of restocking the refrigerator. I usually start from the fresh produce on the very right side of the market. Everything is very cost efficient compared to other(American) grocery stores. Also, the products are always oh so fresh. Both conditions are to be met at all times due to the major clientele base of H mart - Korean housewives/ mothers. They just know. How? Beats me. I find that H mart's mushrooms and broccoli selection is one of the freshest in town. 

If you like sauces you've had at some Asian restaurant, they most likely have it here. 

AND they have fresh pork belly(the-never-frozen kind!)

I frequent this place and if you haven't been there, I strongly urge you to go. One downer is that the parking lot is so impossible to get in & out...but that really doesn't stop me from going there.

Ok, so I made an appointment, as recommended on their website. The place was already very busy, but I was immediately introduced to a ""stylist"" and taken back to the dresses. Yay.  I was looking for a formal evening gown for a red  carpet event and had printed out several pictures from their website to give an idea of what I was looking for. She didn't even glance at them and proceeded to tell me that my budget ($300 or less) restricted me to clearance dresses only. I was thrown by this since many of the dresses I saw on their website were listed at $250. When I said as much, I received an exasperated eye roll and was told that they don't carry anything that ""cheap"". THEN TAKE THAT OFF YOUR WEBSITE!!!! I became even more frustrated when it became clear that not only were the prices wrong, but the website leads you to believe that they have a huge selection of styles and colors, when that is not at all the case. 
We managed to find 3 dresses for me to try on and then we went to the dressing rooms. First of all, they literally have a timer outside each room and they time you. If I could pick one word to describe my appointment, it would be ""rushed"". I was rushed to pick out dresses, then rushed to try them on. I swear I got to spend all of 1 minute looking at myself in a dress before I was hurried along to take it off and move on to the next. You will be required to wear gloves. They state this on the site, but it's still annoying. Also, they won't let you take any pictures. WTH? I had to go shopping alone but I needed a second opinion. Pretty much impossible when you aren't allowed to get a picture. The third dress I tried on was actually great, I loved the color, the fit, almost everything about it. There was something wonky with one of the bra pads sewn in so I asked about fixing it. At first, there was no seamstress that could talk to me. When one did show up, she wasn't able to tell me whether or not she could fix it. I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a dress that might be unwearable. No one seemed to care, because at this point I was told ""it's already on sale, there is nothing we can do"" (which came across as ""either buy the dress or get out, you're wasting our time"". Apparently they couldn't care less about selling you a quality product. 

In the end, I walked out without a dress. In a way, I was glad that I didn't have to give them my hard earned money after the, shall we say, underwhelming customer service I experienced.",2016-02-05 22:07:20,négatif,négatif

Firstly this is not really an Indian restaurant and it definitely is not a South African restaurant.  It is Indian food that comes from South Africa.  This may seem a subtle difference, but if you are either you will notice right away.  Indians who migrated to Africa (I am one), could not find their normal ingredients to create typical dishes and thus a fusion came about using local ingredients and Indian cooking techniques.  In most of Africa this resulted in a milder and more subtle flavors.

The decor is very nice and open, perfect for large groups and families.  This is a family run business and you will definitely meet them at some point in the evening.  They are charming and quite happy to chat and answer all your questions.

This is a buffet, but to it's credit it has something for everyone and makes it perfect to try many new things.  They claim everything is organic and free range and thus the moderately high price (25$).  The quality is evident and I considered it good value.  The food itself is good, in a buffet you will have the hits and the misses and this was no exception, but I found enough that I liked to be satisfied.

Having spent 6 weeks in South Africa last year, I was hoping for a couple of dishes or at least wines that could take me back to that wonderful country but unfortunately this was not the case.  They mentioned they were trying for a better South African wine selection, but it would take some time.

Overall a good restaurant, perfect if you want to try,or introduce someone to a milder less spicy Indian cuisine.",2011-02-28 21:37:55,positif,positif

It came highly recommended to my boyfriend and I from our friend, so we came on a Saturday night around 8pm. They don't take reservations, but we were luckily able to snag a table outside without any wait. Our waitress was extremely friendly and restaurant staff - including the owner - came out to greet us and make sure we were enjoying everything throughout. 

FOOD:
Everything was amazing. Each dish was brought out sequentially, which was really nice because everything stayed hot and there was enough time in between each dish for us to build up eager anticipation for the next! 

We ordered:
- Pesca bruschette: Oh my god. So so good. Our favorite of the night. Wish I took photos but I devoured it too quickly! Their bread comes from Oat Bakery next door, which has become my favorite bread bakery of all time. The bread was incredible - so soft on the inside but crunchy on the outside. It's covered with stracciatella, peach, sunflower seed and pine nut maple gremolata, basil and arugula. Perfect blend of savory and sweet and it was so light and refreshing. I'd go back for this every day if I could. 
- Porchetta bruschette: Also so good, though not quite as good as the pesca. The pork was incredibly flavorful. I couldn't taste the citrus flavor it says it has according to the menu, which could have elevated it to an even higher level, but it was very tasty anyways. 
- Gnocchetti with shrimp and pesto: Great pesto sauce. I liked the pasta a lot because it was pretty light, but it was cooked slightly too al dente for my personal preference. Shrimp was tender also. 
- Affogato: Quite possibly the best affogato I've ever had! I've normally only ever had affogato with vanilla ice cream, but the hazelnut ice cream with hazelnut crunch on the outside was insane. Soo good we had to slurp the last of the espresso with melted ice cream!

DRINK:
- Non-alcohol hugo spritzer: Very refreshing, loved the elderflower flavor and was really reasonably priced at $5! Appreciated the option for non-alcoholic on this one.

Makes the best of it's relative small spice in terms of seating.  It is basically a square with tables against both walls and then down the center.  You have a view of the counter and kitchen in the back.  Definitely super casual.

The server promptly serves chips with salsa, however, the chips were topped with refried beans and cotija cheese - nice touch.  I'm sure if we wanted plain chips it wouldn't have been an issue.  Salsa was fresh made and very good.  Off to a good start.

We started with the puputas - corn masa stuffed with cheese and pork (there also is a bean option).  I love masa and pork, but for some reason I didn't love these.  The texture was chewier than expected, and the pork had an overly smoked taste.  Others seemed to enjoy it however.  

After chips with beans, and the puputas, I really was not that hungry so ordered one chorizo and one carne asada taco.  They did not come with any vegetables on the side, which really was fine with me, but if you're used to eating tacos at most restaurants you may be confused.  The chorizo and carne asada were absolutely delicious.  The quality of the carne asada here could be served in a fancy pants plate with a jose garces sticker slapped on it and you could sell it for 4 times the price.

My buddy ordered the shrimp fajitas, they looked, stunning.  You could tell how fresh it was and the shrimp were large.  Much better than any fajitas I've seen in recent memory, and my buddy vouched for its taste as well.

I'm pretty impressed with this place.  They do have a legitimate full hoagie shop menu including fried apps, cheesesteaks, hoagies, wraps etc if you happen to have a member of your group who would rather have a turkey wrap than a spicy chorizo taco.

My wife and I just got married and are planning to start a family, so we were looking for a large enough house in a good school catchment and a fun but safe and family-oriented neighborhood, within our budget, AND with high ceilings (I'm 6'8""). We were looking for a house we could see ourselves in for at least ten years. No small feat in the highly competitive and fast-moving real estate market environment that Philly is right now.  We couldn't have done this without Paul.

Paul was extremely patient with us from the beginning. We looked at dozens of houses slowly finetuning our needs and wants, which for my wife and I were quite different in certain areas at the start. While we were looking at houses Paul shared just the right amount of information on value, immediate neighborhood and his opinion on how each house could be improved. There was no pressure applied on his part; he did a really good job of staying unbiased and open minded. He never discouraged us from looking at any particular house. I think he really gets the decision-making process people go through to find what they are looking for and understands the Philly market well.

When we finally decided upon a house, Paul guided us through a relatively stress-free offer, negotiation, and settlement process. We decided to ""jump on"" our house after only seeing it once, and given how fast homes are selling in Philly, we felt the need to act quickly. Paul made sure our offer got in at the end of a long workday, and we were under contract before the first weekend when apparently a mass of showings had been scheduled. Once we were under contract, Paul brilliantly negotiated a seller's credit that was significantly higher than we expected. We asked him how he did it, and he said simply that negotiation is his favorite part of the job. There were no hiccups while under contract at all, and Paul and the fantastic mortgage broker he recommended (Adam Funck of Annie Mac) were well ahead of any potential delay or missing information. Closing was a breeze, and we were in our new house before we knew it.

Paul is smart, experienced, professional, good humored and was a pleasure to be around during what can be a stressful process. While house-hunting, my wife and I heard several stories from frustrated buyers who lost out on favorite homes because of mistakes or missteps made by realtors or mortgage brokers, so we feel extremely fortunate to have worked with Paul. I would highly recommend him as a realtor and I plan to work with him again soon on finding an investment property.",2016-07-17 11:48:34,positif,positif

With how late we started our day, we and other groups ended up waiting down the street at another establishment until the seating host radioed in that our table was ready. Loved the warmth of the sun through the window at my back.

Fried green tomatoes were recommended by one of the bartenders from the night before, so John and I ordered a plate to share around the table. Even our resident anti-tomatoite Kevin found them unoffensive, since they tasted like the fried batter more than the tomatoes themselves. The bed of unwilted organic salad greens served to help drain the residual fryer grease.

The others were content with their food: Julie's two eggs over easy with a biscuit, Ginny's breakfast quesadilla with tofu instead of ham, John's three egg omelet with chorizo, tomato, and cheddar, and Kevin's two giant buttermilk pancakes with bananas and peanut butter chips, plus turkey bacon. I was most jealous of Kevin's plate, largely from my astonishment that each pancake was the size of my head. Thankfully they took it easy on the powdered sugar.

Multiple latkes were ordered and I personally found them just shy of inedible. Potato dominated in texture, and the overall flavor was overwhelmed by the oil they were fried in. I generally enjoy a nice crunchy crust, but I felt that our batch was a bit too aggressively browned. I tried swiping it through the country gravy to improve the taste but eventually gave up on my latke. On the other hand I had no complaints about the full-sized PoBoy. The gently finessed chorizo omelette was folded into thirds. Instead of the traditional fixings, it's topped with a healthy ladling of creamy country gravy. I'm glad they saw fit to toast the open faces of the baguettes, since it kept the bread from getting overly soggy after inevitable gravy exposure. I also knife-and-forked this into manageable handling portions, but was ultimately defeated by the sheer volume of food in front of me.

Three and a half stars. Service was friendly enough, though we had to flag them down by hand for beverage refills once we got our food. Bathrooms acceptably clean. Cash only but the ATM in the corner makes it convenient for the easily forgetful. Cozy diner feel matches the homey food. I feel like this was the Roscoe's of Philly for me. I listened to too much of the hype and ended up with the impression that it was only okay. The food portions are ridiculous, but nothing about my brunch here blew my mind.

Upon arrival on the day of the move around 9:00am, I should've been alarmed seeing the next red flag--a Budget rental truck. The two employees could not have been nicer, BUT NOT EX-MILITARY! They asked to see the contents at which time they said, ""Well, this is going to be more than the quote. The sales guys give the quotes & don't really know.

Long before the ""renaissance"" of Frenchmen, dba was pouring excellent drinks, providing a great listening room for great music.   I think that dba offers a ""grown-up"" environment that avoids stuffiness and rebuffs the over-served bourbon street crowd while paying equal attention to music (if you are a chatting f*^kwit you're not welcome at some shows and will be asked to keep it down) and what they pour and how they pour it.

There are ""two-ish"" spaces here.  When you enter the right side is the main bar where people congregate until the music begins (or overflow when it is particularly crowded - which is often- in a good way). The left side of the building offers a continuation of the bar but features the stage for music and a dance area (or standing room when not a big dance night) to see the featured act.

Dance floor is filled for some sweet swing on some nights and packed on others to hear New Orleans' favorite bands.  Two shows on most nights and three on weekends - with music that ranges from swing to funk to brass and everything in between.  The early show often doesn't require a cover but a one drink minimum.  Later show averages $10 cover but a few bands are more.

Explained what was wrong and was told to come back and get some. Seriously? It's rush hour and on a very busy street!  Asked for a credit and was told there was nothing they could do, but for me to come back and get them.  I guess that's a good thing because WE WILL NEVER GO BACK.",2019-12-06 00:38:31,négatif,négatif

I go here with my boyfriend a lot since we can always count on a great meal in a sultry atmosphere. The cocktails aren't really worth the price--too bitter for my taste and not enough liquor for the price. Stick with the wine because they have a great selection! 
We always order the raw fish special and it NEVER disappoints. Their moules (an app) are great in a delicious creamy broth that is big enough for a girl's entree if you're not trying to walk out with a food coma. The hearts of palm salad is fresh and light--just olive oil and shavings of parmesan is a clean, delicious dish. I also recommend the chicken soup--a simple chicken broth with fresh vegetables and a poached egg...a sophisticated twist on the classic. 
My boyfriend loves the juicy hangar steak served rare with Lilette's specialty fries on the side. and it's served with some bone marrow. YUM.
For dessert, they have an amazing chocolate hazelnut mousse which you have to have if you love chocolate and nutella. they sprinkle some fleur de sel on top which adds just the right amount of saltiness to bring out the sweetness in the chocolate. Or if you want something more light, Lilette always has a refreshing sorbet--our favorite is the basil grapefruit. 

Our only complaint is that the service is kind of iffy. Their servers aren't as attentive or polite as I wish they would be, especially Louis T., who is actually kind of an asshole. But one server isn't going to ruin it for us considering the food is just delish and is one of our favorite spots for birthdays, anniversaries, and romantic mid-week dates.

You can pick up some business cards for all of them -- and get up to speed on the empire's holdings -- at the host/hostess's podium. Or give them to your kid and say they're just as good as baseball cards.

While you won't run up a shock 'heart attack' bill, Zahav's P2P isn't great. The large entrees are comparable to the typical appetizer or snack at other places, and you really have to order 3-5 to feel satisfied.

Booking Brigalias was easily the best decision I made during my entire wedding planning process. From the moment I stepped in there during their open house in October 2017, I knew this was my venue. The chapel alone was enough to make me fall in love completely. From day one of booking, they were helpful with answering my many questions and the day of the wedding they went above and beyond to make sure everything was exactly how I wanted. This included literally last minute uplighting changes and centerpiece changes. They did it all without batting an eye. Diana is the sweetest person ever and is truly committed to designing your wedding exactly how you envision it. Jessica was our bridal attendant and I couldn't have been happier with her. She made sure we had everything we needed (even things we didn't know we would need LOL) She graciously handled my very energetic toddler during important parts of the reception where we couldn't keep our full attention on him. She was hands down AMAZING! Brigalias also took extra care of the head tables as well. The food was seriously amazing. I still have guests tell me to this day that my wedding was one of the best they have ever been to, and the amount of food during cocktail hour and dessert alone is no comparison to any other place. Seriously, the entire room was filled with dessert! I wish I got to enjoy it myself LOL. Not just the food, the new Grand Ballroom is to die for and I am so thankful I was able to have my reception in it.

With COVID-19 changing the way we not only live and disrupting our day to day routines it has affected our way communication. Many businesses and restaurants especially have relied on on-line and over the phone services lately and MSBC has done just that. However, I experienced some ""technical difficulties"" this morning whole trying to call in a to go order. 

The phone was left off the hook for some time. Approximately 30 minutes. Until then someone put the places the phone back on the hook and I was able to call. 

Once I finally got in touch with the restaurant the Front of house staff member answered very politely, friendly, and kindly which is always nice. However, the background was so loud I could hardly understand her and she could hardly understand me and naturally this caused a rough communication between us. But!! I understand she had little control over the diner being too loud. So I wasn't upset about it at all. If you do call however expect it to be kinda loud... when I picked up my order it was packed to the 50% seating rule and the chefs and back of house was clamoring to get what I think was a mass of to go orders (it was Memorial Day after all) 

When arriving the parking lot was easy to access and walking to the front door and inside everything was well lit, decorated and VERY clean! To say the least I felt more safe inside the restaurant than I did in my own home! All employees were wearing masks, enforcing the 6ft rule and maximum capacity rules strictly. I got my order and returned home. 

I ordered ""the five"" which was made of ""Flaky biscuit, all natural fried chicken breast, pecanwood smoked bacon, a fried egg* and cheddar cheese topped with our house-made sausage gravy with a kick."" 
1340 Calories LOL oh well it was Memorial Day lol all worth it. 

The food was packaged neatly and orderly. Still hot when I made the 10 minute drive back home. The flaky biscuit was drenched in their signature gravy, the chicken was well cooked and every bite was juicy and flavorful with perfectly seasoned chicken, melted cheese and crisp smoked bacon. 

This made me want to go to the mountains and sit on the balcony of a log cabin paired with their signature black coffee ! 

I give 4/5 stars due to the over the phone ordering system they have in place. It could use some work but they are just kids in the FOH it seemed like and everyone was professional and kind. Like I mentioned above the food was phenomenal but very very heavy and very greasy. This is not a factor in the rating however because it clearly stated what's in it and the calories so I willing ordered this with that in mind, just more of a heads up to someone else.

Dive bars and po'boys just go together, right?  Parasol's bar is your classic no frills watering hole, good for a little conversation and beer.  The crowd was a healthy mix of regulars and tourists during my late afternoon weekend visit, with the bar filling up and half emptying out a few times while I was there.  And why was I there?  I was there for the po'boys.  I after completing a self-guided tour of the garden district I realized I needed a beer and a glass of water, and that Parasol's was a mere 10 minute walk away.  I had recently had lunch and was in no way hungry, but I accepted that gluttony was in the cards for me because Parasol's is known for their po'boys.  Torn between the regular shrimp po'boy and the firecracker shrimp po'boy I was persuaded by the person who took my order to go with the firecracker shrimp because ""we are the only ones in New Orleans with it on the menu"".  I was not disappointed with my choice, in fact it was my favorite po'boy of the trip.  The shrimp are breaded and fried and dipped in a type of spicy buffalo sauce.  It is a spicy sandwich to be sure, but not too intense.  The bread was perfect, and the accompaniments (lettuce, tomato, pickles, rémoulade sauce) were spot on in terms of ratio and quality.  I think the pickles in the sandwich were the ingredient that pushed it over the top for me.  One word of caution, when ordering you must choose between regular and large size.  I ordered regular and it was a foot long.  I have no idea how big a large is, but I'd proceed with caution.  Also, as with all the other po'boys I ate in Nola, the sandwiches are over flowing with shrimp, so even if you are real hungry, remember you have a whole sandwich to eat plus the 20 shrimp on the side that fell off the sandwich.",2018-05-10 19:36:41,positif,positif

The differences in price mean you get to use there towels and what areas of the gym and equipment you get access to.

Being from NYC and having lived in South Beach FL, Washington DC, Salt Lake City and Houston TX, I am comparing to other gyms in the same price range for service, group classes, and cleanliness. 

Location is not the best.   Yes, it's in the heart of Nashville, but it is located in a hard to get to area and parking is not really easy.   Actually it is really weird because of all the construction going on, so maybe just maybe this problem will change after construction is over.  An upside is you do get 2hr complimentary parking if can find one in their lot.

Friendly stuff but kind of pretentious.   The place looks ok and small especially for a name like ""WORLD GYM."" The front desk and membership areas are small and open.   They have a mini store with t-shirts with the name of the gym.  Quality ok, but not the best. 

Main floor is home to the cardio machines and a big open studio.   Kind of a let down when I found out there is only one dance class on Friday afternoon.  There were a few other classes offered.

Downstairs I will call it the basement -is dark, busy and smelly. As soon as you go down the stairs there was very powerful smell of sweat.   The bathroom smelled of urine.  So needless to say at that point I was already like thank you but NO thank you. 

I did ask the owner about more classes.   I think his name is Johnny. He said people don't participate in classes they offer, and will not pay for a full service club.

They do offer a few extras like towel service, massage chairs and red light therapy.  However, you also get that at Planet fitness for only $10 or $20 a month and at least clean bathrooms.

This compared to places NY or DC Sport Club, Equinox in NYC and Miami, The Villa Sports Club at the Woodlands in Texas,  The GYM at City Creek in Salt Lake City. All these places offer a full service club for less then what this place is asking for.

In my opinion ""WORLD GYM"" is at the same level as a 24 hrs Fitness or Planet Fitness,  but with prices that rival a full service sports club.  Not worth it.",2018-07-22 20:16:24,négatif,neutre

I took my family there after the Walk For Autism for my 4-year-old. There were 8 of us and we were ready to eat. First, it took 40 minutes to get our drinks. The waitress then brought out plastic forks and knives for us to eat with. After we found out the waitress who was working pretty much alone, she informed us our food would be out soon.

We were ready to eat and go. We alert the waitress after we couldn't find her for another fifteen minutes. She apologizes. It was a lot of her fault. She was awesome!

Although they seemed busy I didn't have to wait to get my nails done. I got my usual acrylic fill over top of my real nails and a gel nail polish top. I got a black tip manicure, instead of the usual white tip. First things first. The nail tech didn't bother cutting my cuticles and pushing them back the first or second time I was there. After about a week they look like crap and need to be filled again. I suppose that is to get people to return more often then usual because I have never heard of any nail salon techs not taking care of your cuticle when getting a manicure. Now this time I get the black tip and as Sue is applying the clear coat she smears streaks of black in every single nail. I pointed it out and she says sorry and continues like normal. OK. I let it go because I needed to be somewhere and it wasn't a complete disaster. Yet. Later that day I notice some of my nails are not completely flat and smooth. It felt like there was a bubble under the nail polish. Nothing I can do now. Three days later on Wednesday my gel nail polish starts chipping. If any one knows anything about gel nail polish is that its more expensive because its not suppose to chip for at least two/three weeks. My experience is that it never chips. Literally chunks of nail polish are chipping off every time I run my fingers through my hair or do dishes or flip through a stack of paper. I go back to Queen Nail Spa to get a refund for my $33 nails that didn't last more then three days. The manager guy first wanted to know who did my nails. Like it matters. They are messed up and the nail polish is half off. We figure out Sue was the one who did my nails. She was pretty pissed off that I was complaining about her work. I was trying to speak with the man about getting a refund and she continues to yell in my ear about her doing a good job and that she will fix them. No Sue you will not touch me ever. I had to interrupt my conversation with the man to ask her to stop yelling in my face. And as she walked away continued to yell at me, WITH A NAIL SALON FULL OF PEOPLE. Professionalism was radiating from this place.  The man refuses to give me a refund. He tells me they are not allowed to give them because he already spent the product to do my nails so they would lose money if they gave me my money back. He also told me that it didn't matter that I was unhappy and that I don't have to come back. What a JOKE! He finally offered to give me a gift certificate for the $18 I paid for the gel nail polish. Not even the total amount I spend including the crappy acrylic refill.

Today I was shopping on magazine store for some Ill swag and I stopped in....I like a light roast but settled on large drip coffee which came out to $ 3.01....the cashier gave me .99 cents change and I Instantly thought I had ingested mushrooms....I was tripping hardcore as I could not understand the .99 change and I still struggle with it and the fact that Michael Dukakis lost......

I tipped the .99 into the jar loudly and the walls breathed and flexed as the floor was also moving near the cream...into my cup!

I had their pomegranate martini which was pretty good and got a raffle ticket with ever drink purchase.  The raffle ticket entered me into the hourly drawing for a free piece of glass.  Tonights pieces were a wine stopper, glass flower, large glass plate and a glass vase.  

In the main room they showed a number of glass demonstrations, it was interactive with the audience asking questions.  You could parooz through the gallery of art and glass plates, bowls, vases, ornaments, etc, all available for purchase or just sit an enjoy the one man guitar band in the main entryway.  

My step-mom and sister were feeling creative and got hand's-on with glass making by designing a tile and a pendant & earing set.  You arrange the hard glass pieces the way you want your design and they cure it for you, for pick up later in the week.  

The best entertainment by far was sitting on their outdoor patio and watching the belly and fire dancing.  They're interactive too, they pulled more than a few audience members into the circle to learn a few booty shaking moves.  It was a lot of fun and my favorite part of the night.

My family had more than a blast here this Friday, we'll probably still be talking about the event in years to come.

I always ask for my sauce on the side because I usually have left overs for the next lunch day the first time I had a Create Your Own (CYO) stir fry with sauce on the side and they forgot it completely so I just ate it dry at work and brought in some soy sauce packets from home and mixed it with honey for sauce for my leftovers the next day.

Well they put the sauce on the side but when I opened my salad there was also sauce on it!

Our party went for brunch. It was truly good, and we would recommend it to anybody. You could put this restaurant on the middle of Boston and it would be overrun. 

We had the fried green tomato eggs benedict, the basin breakfast and the chicken & waffles.  

One of us described the eggs benedict as ""the best I've had in a long time"" and as ""designed to hit every pleasure spot.""  

The Basin breakfast had several high points.  Bacon was grilled, so it was much smokier and juicer than most.  The boudin ball was crispy and flavorful, a great intro for the boudin-neophyte.  Scrambled eggs were plentiful, fluffy and swimming in butter.  Yum.  

Chicken on waffles is called ""hot,"" but it's not Nashville hot.  Still real good.  Served in honey.  

App was the crab ""biegnets.""  Served in remoulade.  Very crispy and tasty. 

The drinks were well done.  Basin has a ""bottomless"" mimosa.  The Bloody Mary was as good as any I've ever ordered. Be sure to ask for it ""topless"" (with pickled vegetables heaving over the top of it). 

Decor is just muddled and odd.  You can tell they're trying to straddle restaurant and bar.  But it still didn't detract from the food.  Good New Orleans = probably some of the best food you've ever had if you're from anyplace else.",2018-04-01 19:23:29,positif,positif

They then proceeded to clean my carpet in the living room and the hallway which had some pretty bad stains.  I was afaid that I would have to pay extra for each of the stains but they quickly informed me that there would be no additional charge for each stain unless there were colors other than black revealed after the initial once over with the machine.  They finished up in about 20 minutes which I was a little worried about at first because I thought, ""Hey I'm paying for this, take all the time you need, as long as you get my carpet clean and the stains out."" but after they left and I allowed the carpet to dry (they said allow 2-3 hours for it to dry but I gave it 4-5 just in case with the windows open)  the stains (4 or 5 of them) were all gone and my carpet looked a lot cleaner.  I'm now going either barefoot or with socks on to walk around my apartment just to preserve the fine work this company has done for me.  All for only $60 !!!! Great value, just what I needed and expected.

For a departure from the seafood we went with a filet and the duck with foie gras. By the time these entrees came out we almost forgot what we ordered. We also waited a very long time for subsequent cocktails. The servers were on top of the orders but the bar couldn't seem to get them out. When our entrees were finally delivered they were not even warm. The waiter apologized and immediately returned them to the kitchen. We then waited a long time again for the re-do. Unfortunately this time they were just lukewarm and did not taste right at all. After a few bites of her filet, my wife actually got sick and had been feeling just fine prior. The floor manager was very apologetic and brought us complimentary strawberry pie and took our entrees off of our bill.

I can't even with normal shoes after this year so I was looking for baby feet size Birk clogs. And they actually had a pair! Yea. And the sales person was super nice and not pushy which is what I've always found with this shop.

gfK1OegyaeHr0IReIeaCvQ,tYO0NYdxFX7eQhLlS_LtPA,arp-UJ5f0kMN47oKuMak3w,1,0,0,0,"I'm writing to inform property owners of my recent experience trying to rent from Prestige. I have an income property in another state and would NOT want a company like this managing it in my absence:

I recently moved to Tucson for work and plan to rent for a year while looking to buy a home. I am a single female college professor--quiet, excellent credit. I am the perfect tenant.

I viewed a townhouse in the Foothills and the location is perfect, the view is spectacular and the price is right. I want to rent this property! It is the rental of my dreams. However, it needs a routine between-tenant cleaning. I informed Prestige, in person with my wallet in my hand, that I would apply now and move in ASAP if they would have the place cleaned--specifically requesting that the carpets be shampoo-ed, the interior walls be patched and painted, and a couple of broken blinds be repaired (they no longer went up and down, so were not functional). 

The office staff acted as if I was asking something out of the ordinary, said they would ""get back to me"" if my requested repairs were going to be possible. I instantly got a bad vibe--as if she just wanted me out of her hair. So I left and waited, hoping for the best. After not hearing anything for several hours, I called to inquired whether my request would be granted. The woman I spoke to still had no clue if it would be possible--and didn't take the initiative to find out. Just said someone (not her, ""someone"") would call me back. It has now been 2 days without word, so I assume I'm out of luck.

I am not overly picky. When I viewed the townhouse, there was food remaining in the refrigerator and kitchen cabinets (it wasn't gross, just some coffee that got left behind), the carpets were dirty--had not been vacuumed so certainly not shampoo-ed, and the walls had many (not just a few--MANY) holes where pictures likely hung from the previous tenant. There were cobwebs on the ceiling and walls, which were several different shades of white and yellowish-white from different patchy paint jobs. The windowsills were grey with dust, there was soot in the fireplace, the air ducts were caked with dust (just the way they get when ignored--not a big deal to unscrew them and spray off in the sink), and I already mentioned that some of the blinds were not functioning.

If my tenants left my condo in this state, I would use part of their security deposit to have it properly cleaned. The maintenance I requested would run me about $400 in Chicago (mostly for the painters), so I imagine its about the same here.

As of this writing, the craigslist ad is still up so I assume the townhouse has not been rented yet. The owner has foregone income--plus the cost of utilities--that I was happy to pay.  I can only assume that Prestige is a slumlord company. My own experience, combined with the other yelp reviews here, give me enough pause to never consider renting with this company.",2014-08-01 03:21:10,négatif,négatif

Ok, so El Sol has good food.  I wouldn't ever dispute that.  BUT, the following things have recently made me have misgivings about this restaurant:

1. The East Washington location was closed for a long time.  Renovations.  I think it had to do with health department issues.  See my next comment.

2. One of the last times I was there, (summer 2006), I saw a cockroach on the wall in the entryway.  EEEEWWWW!!! 

3. Their margaritas are potent - I was always under the impression that they were made by hand.  However, last summer I saw them pouring my margarita - from a premixed bottle that is available from your favorite Costco location or local liquor store.  Talk about being ripped off - so I can't bear to order margaritas from El Sol anymore.

Since El Sol's Washington Street location wasn't open for so long, I made another good find with Adobo Grill's location on the northside.  That place frickin' rocks.  It's pricy, but delicious!!!",2007-01-22 23:02:33,neutre,neutre

I feel if so many aren't working on a particular day, the price should be reduced for that day because essentially what are people paying for? The rides that the kids did get to ride they enjoyed. My youngest was too short to ride some of the rides but overall the girls had a blast! After so long, I think they were hot and we were all ready to go. Busch Gardens is a pretty big park. Like most amusement parks, be prepared to walk. The only other thing I did not like was the rides seemed so spaced apart. I know this may sound weird because you're thinking rides and they are huge, but something about the distance 3 rides took up/covered seemed off. Overall, it's a typical amusement park. I don't think it's anything special, but you can certainly have fun!",2021-09-04 11:13:02,neutre,neutre

My engine oil was 4 quarts low and I had metal to metal brakes.  They said they could not test drive it unless the brakes were fixed and the oil changed.  This is an older car and I did not want to put a bunch of money in it if there was something major.  So they fixed the brakes, changed the oil and did their initial diagnostics.  The oil change was over $100.00 which included rotating the tires.  I told them I did not need the tires rotated but they said it was part of the service and they just don't change oil unless you pay for the total package.So my initial bill came to over $800.00.  There conclusion was that the code came up saying I need 3 other diagnostics test done which will cost an additional $200.00 for total over $1000.00.  At this point I took my car back and still have no clue what is wrong with it.  When I take it to the salvage yard it will have clean oil and new brakes. In all fairness they took of the cost for the initial diagonals and we had a communication problem which contributed the situation.  I still have no clue what is wrong with the car.  One note is that there estimate for the  oil change was around $116.00 for changing the oil, rotating the tires and checking the fluid, etc. I can get the same oil change a Jiffy Lube for around $75.00",2018-05-14 04:24:37,neutre,négatif

We actually ended up there a couple of nights, the food and ambiance was so good! It is a little loud, but that's to be expected when so much gorgeous wood is used in the construction and decor.
The bar design is unique and original, with the taps coming out of a maze of pipework like something out of a steam engine. The display case with their top shelf liquors is bright and tantalizing, and the dark wood all around is absolutely beautiful.
The service was excellent, even at a brand new restaurant, and the food...the food was outstanding. Definitely try the Smoked Mozzarella appetizer, the tomato jam they set it on is out of this world!

William is an expert in all things wine so while you are on the bike he will fill you in on the history of the area and give you some really interesting background on the wine. 

The bikes were fit perfect to all of us.  There was another small group with us, a mother and her two adult daughters.  One of them is expecting and the other brought her small dog along for the ride in a backpack. William did a great job checking in on everyone and making sure the pace worked for all of us.  The area we went through was absolutely breathtaking!  There are a few stops along the way so that folks can take bit of a break if needed as well. At mile 11 there was a vineyard with wine tasting and the rest of our party decided to get off the bikes there while my husband and I finished the ride with William.  It was great that there was an option for folks to end a little early or continue on - highly recommend doing the entire 15 miles!

The bike tour ended in the small town it started at.  We did a wine and olive oil tasting there then we all went to another vineyard to enjoy and amazing lunch and had another wine tasting.  All 5 of us were going on and on about how great the day was, how incredible the lunch was and ways that we could help spread the news about how great the tour was.   

If you are reading the reviews and still unsure if you should do the tour - reach out to William (he owns the company and does the tours).  He will cover any questions or concerns you may have.  The girls did this and asked if they could bring their dog - turns out we have a dog as well so we didn't mind at all.  

I would 100% recommend this tour to anyone that likes being a little active, is decent at riding a bike and enjoys wine.",2014-06-12 01:19:37,positif,positif

I think Froyo joints outnumber McDonalds and Starbucks combined in this town, now.  You can't walk a block without passing at least two frozen yogurt places (Please excuse my imprecise diction, but there really is no word to describe froyo ""places"". Coffee and espresso are at a cafe, ice cream at an ice cream parlor, popsicles at a popsicle stand, convenient items at a convenience store, steak at a steak restaurant, but what would be a fitting word to place after frozen yogurt? Oy, the dilemma of the English language). It boggles my mind that they all are still staying in business. This must only suggest that the average Nashvillian replaces one meal of their day with frozen yogurt. Seriously, people, the first step is to admit that you have an addiction.

Anyway, with that being said, I like Sweet Cece's because it's self-serve and has a variety of fresh fruit, candy, and other fun toppings.  The yogurt flavors rotate now and then but I am a personal fan of the Original Tart and also the Pomegranate Raspberry Sorbet (usually you can get these swirled together for an incredible combination).  There's always a staff member in charge of the yogurt dispensing machines, willing to give you a sample of any of the flavors before you make a decision. Although, they give you deceptively large buckets to place your yogurt in--I mean seriously, who can honestly eat THAT much yogurt?! (Okay, maybe I shouldn't have asked for a challenge)  

What separates Sweet Cece's from the rest though is the abundant topping selections.  Anything from cheesecake, blueberries, adorable mini gummy bears, other gummy phenomena, peanut butter chips, almonds, oreo cookies, brownies, and cereal.  Although, beware, if you get anything from the tall cylindrical columns, it will come pouring out before you know it.  My only criticism is that sometimes the fresh fruit isn't as fresh as I would like and I wish they expanded a bit more on this end.

The prices tend to be a little cheaper here than PinkBerry (but I do appreciate some of the offerings PinkBerry has over Sweet Cece's). They also have a frequent customer rewards card.  So, it's a good place to feed your froyo addiction.",2011-03-25 02:08:06,positif,positif

I really wanted to like this sandwich shop, but it just didn't compare. I would say it's a solid 2.5 - 3 star shop...just average. I hate to say this, but I would probably pick Port of Subs over The Lunch Box if I was in the area.

PROS
- Local ingredients (or so they say).
- Locally owned
- Generous portions of meat 
- Nice array of toppings
- Great salad menu (I will try a salad next time and update my review).
- Good selection of bread 

CONS
- They were out of smokey cheddar cheese
- Inconsistent cheese slices (cheese was cut by hand and a bit too thick).
- Bread was a bit dry

Facility -  overall a nice sized facility with a wide variety of pitches.  Even on busy days, there's enough room to climb without having to wait for others to finish.  There's a 2nd level with simpler pitches that are good for beginners or little ones. 

Let me warn you that you are immediately hit with the overwhelming smell of stinky feet the minute you walk into the place.  I mean...whoa!  Outside of the assault on your olfactory senses, the facility is clean and tidy.

Equipment - the rental equipment isn't refreshed that often it appears and every time we've gone the equipment was clearly well used and marginally maintained.

Staff - very hit or miss.  Unfortunately, I've most often been met with the proverbial disenchanted millennial who makes you feel like you're sucking the life out of them just by being there.  

Biggest BS Factor - The $15 ""belay lesson"" is a total rip off.

I just needed to confirm the dimensions and get some questions answered regarding shipping; an the current promotion they are running for the holiday weekend (Cyber Monday to be specific). Well after walking in and inspecting the table, measuring it myself with a measuring tape I looked around for a sales associate to answer a few questions. 

5 minutes went by no associates approached me despite there being several (I counted 4 female & 1 male associate) in the immediate area. I tried to flag one down but they seemed far more concerned with chatting & rearranging the store than making a sale. Now a little annoyed I decided to make a lap around the store in hopes of getting the attention of someone interested in selling the furniture in the store. After completing a lap i returned to the table, waited another 5 minutes with several associates walking by but never inquiring if they could help. 

I'm sorry but at a certain point it becomes about the principle of providing basic customer service.  I'm not going to chase down folks whose job it is to sell & assist customers so I can have the privilege of spending hundreds of dollars in their store. I won't be spending a dime at the Hyde Park West Elm, they have plenty of competitors who make equal or better furniture who actually give a bleep about their customers.

We agreed on the fact that it is always a bit unsettling when you are the only ones in the restaurant.

The restaurant was clean and elegant and the menu was extensive, with pictures of almost every dish. The staff was friendly and the wait time to get food was normal. If I had any complaint there, it would be that my food came out about 5 minutes before the hubs' - which is a bit of a pet peeve. 
I chose the garlic prawns and sea scallops which was underwhelming. There was little hint of garlic, the portion was small for the price and the steamed broccoli upon which it was served was only lukewarm. 
The hubs had a great meal, however. He ordered the lamb shank which was served with potatoes and onions smothered in a slightly spicy curry sauce. He proclaimed it some of the best lamb he had ever eaten. I sopped up some of his sauce with rice and it was bold and flavorful.

The first time I went here, I was super disappointed in the soft tofu stew I ordered.  The broth tasted watery and not very authentic. Maybe this was partially my fault for ignoring the cashier recommendations (bibimbap or Korean fried chicken). 

The second time I came here I ordered the make-your-own bibimbap (with a stone pot) and it totally redeemed rice & mix!! You can pick 5 veggies, 1 protein, and a mild/med/spicy gochujang sauce. This will set you back around $12, which is reasonable imo. The best part of this was how long the bowl stayed hot!! Literally 30 minutes later, the rice was still crackling and I was able to get a good sear on my rice and mushrooms. Very impressed. 

Additional notes:
- Not a traditional place, as there is no banchan here :(
- most bibimbaps come with a raw egg, but here that's an add on charge of $1

Now coming to the important aspect - Taste n Quality of their food..... its a definitely a thumbs down.
I have been going to PENANG for over 10 years n till date their taste n quality remains as it was all those years back.
It is not even worth writing about every dish, since none of the 3 dishes me n my wife ordered were impressive. We ordered the roti canai which was so-so.

I paid in full as required and was told by the sales person I'd get a delivery date texted. It's 3 weeks later, and all I've received is a text to say I have no delivery date. I called the company and was routed to a call center who said they still didn't have a delivery date but were trying to get one. While on hold, I was listening to their marketing boast that they design and make their own furniture, have their own distribution centers and handle their own delivery. So the failure to arrange a delivery for a fully purchased product is squarely on the shoulders of Ashley. I was then told I have to go to the store or try to get through to them to cancel the order. After 14 calls to the local store, I was able to cancel the order and pay a 10% penalty! I just paid $100 for this store who can't deliver what I purchased! I'd rather give them that than $1000. I will never shop there again. I was told this is a problem in the furniture industry right now.

We were both born and raised in Hawaii and lived almost our whole lives there, so we've been really missing local food from home now that we've transplanted to Georgia. Sure, we can make a lot of the dishes back home, but it's different not being able to just pull up to a spot to get the comfort food we're used to when we don't want to cook. There were like two places in the Atlanta area that did Hawaiian-Asian style plate lunches like this and now only one of those is still open near us, so it was awesome to find this place while traveling. 

There's a small parking lot to the side and around the little building, with a seemingly ample amount of stalls as it was dead when we went. There's a picnic table behind the store, but we decided to eat in, since we were the only ones ordering at the time. The guys were super nice at the counter when we ordered and brought our food to the table for us when ready. We got the canned Liliko'i juice, spam musubis, and two Big Kahuna plates which consisted of shoyu chicken, kalua pig, teriyaki beef and white rice with pineapple coleslaw on the side. Everything was awesome - big portions and authentic flavors! I know some people will argue that kalua pig is not authentic unless cooked in an imu, but you do what you gotta do here in the mainland USA with limited resources. Now if there was an easy way to access Hawaii brands of Portuguese sausage, poi, and lau lau (with the true taro leaves), then we'd be all set. 

All in all, we really enjoyed the food and atmosphere and are looking forward to coming back next time we're in Florida again. The food paired with a day at beautiful Siesta Key made this first time trip to Florida together a memorable one that evoked sweet nostalgia from home. If you've never had a local plate lunch from Hawaii, stop in here if you're in the area.

We salivated by the homemade pies available at every corner, and indulged in a bit of Jeni's ice cream as well as lunch in the restaurant area. I headed over to the Sloco organic sandwich section while my partner lined up for a breakfast crepe. Both of us waited only a little while for satisfying and rich lunch time deliciousness.

The menu is extensive. They have seasonal specials, pastas, salads, meat entrees, and seafood dishes. The prices are extremely reasonable for such tasty food and portions. The dishes were very large and the waitress even gave us a portion to take home when our dishes weren't listed under the section of the menu with that offer! She was super friendly and helpful. 

I got an Italian salad for start and it was perfectly dressed and very tasty; as a vegan, I eat a ton of salad, and this one was definitely up to par. The rolls they served complimentary before ordering were warm and fluffy, with quality olive oil to dip. I had the kitchen create me a dish with wheat pasta, veggies (onions, zucchini, peppers, etc), and marinara. Sooo tasty! Like mom's homemade Sunday gravy. My brother and other companions all praised their dishes as well - lasagna, chicken parm, and fettuccine Alfredo; check out my photos for them!

There was no vegan dessert option, sadly, as pretty much all restaurants neglect to put on the menu. The people I was with for creme brûlée, apple crostini, lemon cookies, and a pound cake slice with caramelized bananas, also in my photos. All smelled heavenly! 

To drink, we split a small pitcher of the seasonal sangria ($26/pitcher): moscato, vodka, strawberry, lemon, cantaloupe, and pineapples. I swear, this was the best cocktail or sangria or wine anything in my entire life! Soooo yummy! Definitely recommend!

The atmosphere on the Saturday evening before Mother's Day was very hectic, but the table was clean and service attentive for the most part.

The only negative was that they gave us a 1.5 hour wait time, then soon they changed it to 2 hours. The majority of our party went to the mall to wait, and 15 minutes later they called to say the table was ready! Not everyone was there yet, so they wouldn't seat anyone and said we only had ten minutes to all be there. Kind of absurd since they gave a 2 hour wait time and called after only 15 minutes...

However, the service was horrendous. We called at 10 am to put our names on the list and were told we would be seated at 11. We had a party of 7 so we drove in two cars. The car that got there first was told that they would not put our names on the list until our whole party was there, and that there were fifteen people ahead of us and now we would have to wait two more hours. We understood that it was a Sunday morning in a busy location so we decided to walk around and wait. When we came back after receiving a text from the restaurant that our table was ready, we were told we still had to wait. The seventh member of the party was parking the car in a spot directly in front of French Toast while the rest of us waited out front. Again, we were told by the host that they wouldn't seat us until she was there and the host also yelled at us for standing in front of the restaurant despite not letting us inside while we waited for out table. Once we finally got our table, we were treated extremely rudely by our waitress Allie who unnecessarily snapped at several members of our group. We are not a difficult group of people by any means so we were shocked that our waitress was being so snippy. She yelled at us for not ordering in the correct order, at one of our friends for being on her phone, and for another friend for asking to use Apple Pay. Allie also neglected to check on us the entire time we were eating and we had to essentially beg her to bring her our checks, which we waited nearly 15 minutes on. When our checks came, we had been overcharged for an item and instead of voiding it, three dollars were thrown at us as compensation.

I got a Groupon for Shine and made an appointment. The day I was there, Laura was the only one there, everyone else was at a convention in San Francisco, so I can't speak for the ventilation as another reviewer mentioned. The salon space is small, but I didn't find it cramped. The decor is contemporary and natural. The product line is wonderful and the staff is knowledgeable about them.  

The last two times I had my hair done in an ""upscale"" salon were both disappointing. One time, the stylist talked the whole time about herself and did only a basic trim on my long hair and charged me $39. The second time, the stylist didn't say anything and did only what I told her to do. I got better service at the Supercuts for $20! 

When I sat down with Laura, she took the time to look at the pictures I brought, look at me and my hair and actually make suggestions about what would look good. I had brought a couple friends with me and she very graciously let them hang out and take pictures. Laura cut almost a foot off my hair and the salon arranged to donate the hair for me. The haircut was exactly what I wanted, even though I didn't know exactly what I wanted! It looks great on me and works great with my very curly hair. Not everyone does well with curly hair, but Laura took the curl into account when cutting and kept scrunching it as she cut to see where it would curl up.

My boyfriend and I had been out drinking and were walking down Bourbon Street on the way back to our hotel. We were both pretty inebriated and having a great time. We pass by the Old Opera House (by the way, don't let the name fool you, this place is just another dumpy Bourbon street bar populated by drunk frat boys), and the lovely hostess in front of the bar starts talking to us. She calls us a cute couple, chats with us for a little while, and ends up offering us shots out of test tubes (don't ask). We're not the kind to refuse a free drink, so my boyfriend and I indulge in ""a few"" shots (crappy booze, by the way). Ten minutes of friendly conversation and a few shots later, our lovely hostess becomes serious, and flatly tells us that we owe her $48. As we realize, we are also surrounded at this point by two big bouncers. 

WTF? She offered us the shots, never said they were for sale, never told us a price or gave us any indication that we'd get charged for them. By that time, she wasn't the friendly person who'd lured us in anymore... We tried to argue with her and her bouncer friends, who decided simply to threaten to call the police: ""You pay or go to jail"". Are you effin' kidding me? Pay or go to jail, for drinks that we never ordered?

We ended up going in the back, talking to the manager (who blended right in in the crowd of dimwitted frat boys), and after a few minutes of argument ended up paying $24 for the shots of crappy booze that we never ordered but were simply put in our hands. 

Lesson learned: Bourbon street is a tourist trap. Don't count on the generosity of strangers there: people are after your money, and will take advantage of your drunkenness to squeeze it out of you. Just pathetic.",2008-03-12 00:38:40,négatif,négatif

I am a frequent visitor here and maybe it's because of the latino/hispanic culture but, the workers here are crazy friendly. They run out of desserts fast here so the owner, Orlando, told me to call in ahead of time and he would save e some-now that's hospitality.

If it's your first time eating food from Nicaragua (which it probably is) then a safe recommendation would be ordering the Carne Asada dish. It's simple but, a common meal from Nicaragua that comes with a marinated steak and your choice of two sides.

Also, with each meal you'll receive a plate containing three condiments: jalapenos, a homemade chipotle sauce, and a green mixture called chimichurri. Don't get me wrong, the food is already good but, adding these tangy mixtures will take your meal to another level. I don't know what or how they're made but, they're amazing.

The only negative (and it's not really a negative) about this place is sometimes the wait after ordering can be a little longer than normal but, I'm sure it's because they cook each meal to order. So when your food arrives it's fresh and steaming hot.

I suggest you get out your comfort zone and give Nicaraguan food a try if you haven't already.",2017-04-04 00:20:57,positif,positif

The two projects were separated by 10 years and the pools were installed at two different locations.

From the beginning of this second engagement, the team at Anthony Sylvan (AS), headed by Sean Donohue, made the design and construction of our 20' X 40' swimming pool stress free. Hours were spent exchanging computer generated designs, schematics and elevations and then physically laying the pool out (which posed difficulties owing to the terrain and nit-picking local zoning officials who seemed more intent on obstructing development in this rural area than aiding rate payers).  AS took the lead on the permitting process, shepherding the permits through bureaucratic malaise and nit-picking. Actual construction was done as and when promised by subcontractors who worked efficiently, cleaned up the job-site after themselves and did not interfere with other trades engaged in an on-going residential construction project. AS's subcontractors were closely supervised by AS Construction Manager, Harald Bottke. Harald, like Sean Donohue, was attentive to our needs, anticipated our questions and concerns and provided us with daily telephonic, photographic and email reports. The construction project was finished as promised and on-budget.

Every step of the way, the pool passed the inspections the first time.

This spring, AS returned to open the pool for the first time. John visited twice during this process, familiarizing us with the equipment.  John was a gentlemen, took his time and was patient with our ridiculous questions.

Our only criticism of AS is that its in-house on-line payment system (ISwim) is somewhat cumbersome. In fairness, though, the system tracks the budgeting and payments well.

We have now used AS twice and would not hesitate to use AS again.",2017-04-23 12:11:01,positif,positif

They also have a great selection of blooming teas.  I had the Japanese rice green tea and it was quite good, went well with the food.

The appies filled me up quite a bit almost to the point I had to get them to go, but forced myself to eat them because they were so good.

So... being a native Texan, I have very particular tastes in BBQ,so it should have come as no surprise that the ribs were just eh, but not awful.  What was awful that visit were the two LONG hairs I found in the beans, YUCK.  

On our next visit, I tried to stick with something more reliable like pizza - plain old pepperoni pizza.  But the one food group I hate is the Onion Family.  For some reason, they put onions on my pizza!  No big deal but I had to pick them off before I could eat them.

Our next visit was just to the bar to watch a band play.  We thought about eating, but when you look through a 10 page menu and NOTHING looks appetizing you know you need to move on.  A couple of suggestions:  cut the menu down to two or three genres instead of eight and for heaven's sake, don't charge so much money to substitute a potato side for a vegetable side!  

Why did I keep going back?  Because my husband's business is located about 1/2 a mile away and it's convenient. But honestly, we've been avoiding it lately until we hear that the menu is changing.

The bar itself is excellent with a knowledgeable staff and varied local and international brews. However the food and restaurant itself is the very definition of ""hit or miss"". Food and service can vary between delicious and attentive to stomach churning and poor. The bar is a solid 4/5 whereas the rest is a 2/5.

Ambiance: Dark and divey that has a definite ""hipster"" vibe. Lots of dark woods throughout, but can feel surprisingly open depending on time of day (natural light helps a lot). The bar area can seat about 20, whereas the dining room can hold about 30 or so. There is also a subtle but pervasive smell of stale beer throughout, which actually makes things better for some odd reason.

Food: You will either have a great meal or a terrible one, with hardly no in between. The broccoli rabe and brussel sprouts are delicious when done right, but can occasionally be so heavily salted you feel like you are chewing on a salt cube. The chili oil on the brussel sprouts is a nice touch, but again buyer beware. I would stay away from the seitan nuggets, they were dry and over-spiced. 

Service: Once again, the bar shines. I can walk in with a vague description of what I want, and the bartender can find the perfect beer for me. The waiters and waitresses can vary between surly and pleasant. Sometimes it seems that my mere existence is a burden to the staff (several times I have waited about 30 minutes to order my food. Just let me give you my money!) 

Drinks: Their local beer selection is quite large, but they still have several international beers (typically Belgian). What I love the most is the incredibly varied styles they serve. Typically you can find you standard IPAs or lagers, but also more exotic styles like wild ales, barrel-aged brews, or various tripels. They do have enough liquor to make a good old-fashioned, but don't expect any crazy cocktails though.",2018-05-09 14:43:36,neutre,positif

-Nice ambience
-I didn't really like the salad bar. Probably because it was truly a salad bar...I think the Chima salad bar had more variety and I enjoyed that one more.
- Meal was just meat upon meat upon meat...not much to say about that. I get full easily so I asked for some pieces at a time. I def enjoyed the meat but I am not wired to go overboard like most people can. 
-I had unlimited supply of wine so I def filled up on that. 
-Dessert was nothing special. I had the cheesecake truffle. But by that time i was soo stuffed and tipsy i just couldn't stand myself.

This is They offered the F150 for the quoted price. Which I asked in the very beginning. So it takes police involvement, 3 wasted hours to fix this solution. All Ashley Hinds had to do was read the email. But caught in a lie and try to up sell me and she was too cowardly to apologize. I guess she wasn't scared to rent the vehicle after all. Holly the only polite professional person took over and completed the reservation. 

So my advice is to stay far away from this branch, Ashley Hinds and the other black female co-worker (didn't get her name and I don't care to know either). You will waste your time, have the police called on you, and have your reservation either canceled or an upgraded vehicle at triple the price. 

Ashley Hinds gives females a bad name. Plays that card when someone points out a mistake. Instantly claim she scared, I'm not honoring that ""you're wrong and I'm calling the police. 

If you want to see the email confirmation for the Nissan and the police information of the officer involved free so free to contact me.",2018-11-05 04:48:12,négatif,négatif

You'll find great quality ingredients at Langenstein's including outstanding Andouille, Tasso, mutlple options for par-boiled rice, etc. - or you can pick up a container to go for $4.95/lb.  Cheap?  Not necessarily.  Outrageously priced?  No.  Trust me, you'd be hard pressed to make most of their soups, gumbos, pastas, or anything prepared for much less at home - and then you'd have to have a great recipe as well as the skill and time to make it as good as Langenstein's.  It's easier for me to walk to Zara's but there is very little in that store that I really trust, it's about equidistant to shop at Whole Foods but there you just don't get the local selection or feel.

There is a new chef, Brandon Busby, who has worked at several 4-star Yelp reviewed restaurants and an positive article about him in Sauce Magazine Aug. 28, 2016.  It also appears new servers and other staff may also, have been replaced (YAY!).  

I sincerely hope this will make a huge positive change.  It would be great to see Molly's succeed.

Unfortunately, I have no chance to try again for myself.  I was visiting from out of town at the time.  I hope there will be no similar reason, like that one for my return to St. Louis, anytime soon(or ever).  But, those of you in St. Louis may want to check it out.

Late June 2016 - I was warned that certain dishes were inconsistent.  It was no better as we continued through our meal.

I ordered the Shrimp Po-Boy.  Supposedly NOLA style.  Not at all.

Been there and this was absolutely not what one expects from a NOLA Po-Boy.  To meet the NOLA standard the shrimp should have been deep fried with a spicy batter.  Not grilled without seasonings.  Cole Slaw (who is Cole anyway that a slaw was named in perpetuity) was seriously needed.

  Using a hard baguette made the whole sandwich difficult to enjoy because, it cut up my plete and caused the shrimp to squeeze out.  The six shrimp were blah.  No taste. The remoulade was fine.  Very little lettuce (caesar salad dressing) not slaw.

The brioche bun on the sizable burger which, a couple of PID enjoyed, would have improved the sandwich.

A PID ordered a cold shrimp cocktail which, came out AFTER all the HOT foods.

The curly fries were inconsistent.  Some were well cooked and others seemed to have been introduced too late to the fryer making them nearly raw.

A Partner-In-Dine ordered the Jambalaya.  Overcooked tough shrimp.  Boiled, bland sausages and slightly under cooked rice.  Very little flavor over all.

The new back room was fine.  The stairs dropping into the sunken room had NO rail and were rather steep.

Given my need for comfort, I immediately thought of pasta because it is INDEED comforting. Specifically fiocchi di pera. As a result, I searched everywhere for a restaurant that delivered and had pear pasta. Enter Bella's.

Bella's has a unique take on pear pasta called the pera satchel. It's fiocchi filled with pear obviously but topped with peas and prosciutto. Admittedly I was hesitant to order this as all the ingredients overwhelmed me, but it's honestly probably one of the better ones of this dish I've had.

Also, can we talk about their huge portions? Typically fiocchi is served as a dozen purses of pasta, but after ceasing my eating, I had eighteen left for the next day. Yes, folks, eighteen! I am still flabbergasted to this day.

And to top it off, in typical fashion, I went overboard and ordered bread and dessert. The bread was probably the one thing I didn't enjoy as I found it bland, but the dessert was godly. The Vesuvio, or their take on molten lava cake, is extremely rich and unless you've got a major sweet tooth, prepare for leftovers of that and the accompanying vanilla ice cream.

Needless to say, I think the only reason I didn't end up in food coma was because I managed to stop eating. So sheer willpower!

However the service was quite a miss. The hostess who sat us literally did not look at us. She just walked us to a table and pointed and said ""Here"" and then walked away to talk to some friends, it seemed. So our first impression was not great. 
Our server was really friendly and nice but very slow. We hardly had our water refilled once and after we paid for the check we waited over 15 minutes to get our card back.

Well, I can say my friend's rec was a good one! My friend had noticed in his previous visits that both Indians and non-Indians alike would come to this restaurant. I take this as a good sign as this usually means you can customize the heat level to your liking and that the dishes are, for the most part, not too strong in any one flavor. The restaurant is quite, cozy? There are maybe 9 tables all decently close to each other. The food makes up for whatever is missing in ambience!

We started with a free Mango Lassi (thanks, Yelp)! We also ordered the Butter Chicken (medium) and the Vegetable Jalfreezi (spicy). The dishes come with rice but we also got garlic naan.. I liked both dishes a lot, I found my friend's vegetable dish to be quite hot so if you don't enjoy spicy food maybe stick to the mild. My ideal spicy level is around a 6 so the medium was perfect for me! 

The portions were quite large, we both ended up having leftovers and the food came out quickly and was hot. We saw a couple waiters carrying sizzlers, I definitely want to try that on my next visit. The service was good, very prompt. I think this is a great place to stop by if you need a quick bite.

It was crowded when we arrived but we only had to wait a couple minutes for our table.  Our table was in a nook at the front of the restaurant by the window which was nice since it was out of the way.  The remainder of the space toward the back looked a bit cramped, so try to get a seat by the front window.  

Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable although his attempts to up-sell on a couple items was pretty apparent.  I appreciated how he filled our water glasses up and left a full bottle of water on the table for us to re-fill at our leisure.  I wish more restaurants would do this.  

The beer selection both bottled and on tab was more than adequate and favored just slightly the craft beer category.  I liked how they had both a craft porter and craft stoudt on tap - in fact, the chocolate pumpkin porter was excellent.  We ordered the  pork pot stickers and deviled eggs for appetizers.  I enjoyed the pot stickers (4 of them); however, the deviled eggs were average at best, and frankly, lacking in flavor, which was disappointing as I was looking forward to them.  It's the only restaurant where I've seen deviled eggs on the menu, so I thought, incorrectly as it turned out, that they must be phenomenal if they're on the menu.  

No matter, as the Fish Tacos that I ordered as my entree (2 for $14) turned out to be the star of the night.  The tacos were on the larger side with plenty of the filling and I thought the guacamole that accompanied them was excellent.  

For dessert, we ordered the Bubbi's Apple Cake and the half-baked Toll-House cookie.  The cookie was mouth-watering and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream - I'd order this again.  I thought the Bubbi's Apple Cake, while generous in portion, didn't really even compare to some of the same apple cakes I've purchased at grocery stores which I have found superior.

Someone else in my party ordered the bison burger.  While I did not try it, he remarked that it was the best hamburger he's ever eaten - very lean but still juicy.  Sounds like the bison burger is another good menu option.

All in all, I'd give it a 3.5 stars - didn't blow my mind but I thought it was a good meal with reasonable prices.",2015-12-02 18:21:18,neutre,neutre

We then re-ordered a deluxe butterburger combo and a salad for me.  My husband said  the burger was okay but tasted strange. (?)  My salad (which I loved up in Wisconsin) had warm, wilted, large chunks of lettuce, soft bacon, some cherry tomatoes and flecks of bleu cheese.  The so-called grilled chicken was lukewarm and tough.  We then ordered 2 cones and I think because we are senior citizens they figured we only deserved a kiddy-size cone.  The whole meal and general atmosphere at the restaurant was disappointing.  I will be waiting until I get back to Wisconsin this summer, to go to Culver's again.  Sure won't go to the Tucson one.

They have a huge full produce section. Usually, everything is crisp and fresh. If it's not, it will be heavily discounted. And when it's discounted, the food is still good so long as you use it within a day or two.

They have all the pantry items you can think of -- and nearly in a huge variety of brands and varieties of flavors. The fridge and freezer section are packed. If you lived in India for a long time and get homesick for something specific, you will very likely find exactly what you want here.  You  buy items for your home shrine, cooking utensils and even cricket gear!

There's a bakery that has great bread every day. Right now, the serve yourself deli is closed due to COVID-19, but they have amazing ""homemade"" pickle and halwa.

The prices are reasonable as well. Very often in Indy, grocery stores like this will have ""exotic"" high end prices.  Here, they are very reasonably priced. If you wanted, this could be your only grocery store.

I have several friends living in Mumbai. I ""take them with me"" shopping many times and show them what is on the aisles.

TaTa's knows how to do a top sirloin and grilled onions sandwich - ginormous in size, the pork was succulently sweet, encased in a french baguette that was a nice blend of greasy and crunchy. 

Overwhelming yumminess in sandwich form, my friends.

The side order of sweet plaintains was well worth the $4 extra dollars - it was also ginormous, and fried to perfection.

One of my cohorts in the trip to TaTa's tried the soup (apparently it's the Cuban version of chicken noodle) and she said it was to die for. My other friend tried the #1, and seemed in food bliss heaven when we finished as well.

TaTa's is tiny, but we managed to snag a table right at lunch hour rush. There was only one server, so we had to wait a bit for drinks/refills/extra sauces, etc., but it wasn't obnoxious. Their prices were a bit high, but well worth it.

Maybe they're onto something with the ""fries as main, burger as side"" ethos. Patties err on the side of thin, which means you've got a lot more crispy, carmelized surface area. The Maillard Reaction = flavor, and I'm glad BFC has that figured out. The buns, near as I can tell, are baked on-site and the toppings are damn good too. Simple. I'm into it.

The eponymous fries are served up with a variety of choices likely to make your head spin. I typically stick with the Laura-derived kind - a potato named Laura! Who knew? The skinny fries (shoestring, curly) tend to be VERY skinny, so unless you love potato chip levels of crispness, I'd opt for the more generous homestyle cuts. 

But sometimes crispy is what you're looking for, especially when you have a ton of sauces to choose from! There's a rotating menu of sauces and flavored salts that represents everything you could think of, from your classic ketchups to your more avant-garde remoulades. I've been meaning to experiment with the cinnamon sugar ""salt"" alongside the blueberry ketchup for a dessert French fry experience. 

There's also a rotating selection of beers on tap, plus still more canned beers to choose from if so inclined. I haven't tried the housemade sodas yet, but it's a quaint touch.

Sometimes the line gets backed up at lunchtime (there are only two registers and the open kitchen is pretty small), but I can't say I mind. But the seating is occasionally rough going, especially at their busier hours - some of the skinny artisanal wooden tables, particularly along the windows, are actually too small to host as many seats as they attempt (6 people are really supposed to sit here?) and they're not *completely* level. So when you've got multiple people trying to sit with trays of burgers and fries plus a pitcher and glasses of beer, sitting at some tables can be a hazardous venture indeed.

But if that's the worst we have to deal with? As long as they keep serving up these burgers, I'll count myself lucky.",2016-05-17 21:45:40,positif,positif
drQakSfXgtjpRsEZfKuvqg,CEY8U3DC3-esXBVkq7mYMA,S07dMpp8f9x7etbGW1L0QA,5,4,1,6,"I proposed to my fiancé here. Yes, Southern is that good.  When I moved to St. Louis two years ago, I came because my then-girlfriend and I wanted to try the famous ribs at Pappy's, but the line was too long. We instead went next door to Southern, where the reasonable wait belied the beatific smile with which we would depart their hot chicken experience. It isn't good--it's possibly the best Nashville hot chicken in the world. 

I know because my fiancé is obsessed with fried chicken: traditional southern, country, Korean, Taiwanese, broasted, you name it.  Inspired by our first Revelation at Southern, we made a weekend pilgrimage to Nashville in search of the source, to pay our respects to the masters. We had fried chicken five-out-of-six meals, including Hattie B's and, of course, where Nashville hot chicken all started, the original Prince's. We were impressed, our taste buds were delighted, but what really amazed us was that the chicken at Southern was better.  Like Rick Lewis had dueled banjos with the devil and emerged with his soul and the best hot chicken recipe between heaven and hell. 

We returned to St. Louis with an even greater appreciation for this gem glistening at our oily fingertips. Since then, every time my then-girlfriend-now-fiancé comes to visit, we have to stop at Southern for four or five pieces of the dark meat (hers ""hot,"" mine ""medium""), a couple sides and some Urban Chestnut or Four Hands brews.  When friends and relatives come through town, I take them here.  When colleagues come in on business, I send them here.  It has become our favorite restaurant.

So when it came time to ask this amazing woman if she would spend the rest of her life eating chicken with me, I knew we had to do it here. A few weeks before the date, I dropped a note on the restaurant website's contact form and Billy the manager got back to me the next day to set up a phone call, excited to be a part of this special day. Apparently, nobody had ever proposed at Southern before, but Billy was happy to help me realize my modest vision and even had some great suggestions which we incorporated into the surprise. Day-of, Billy and his staff were also extremely helpful dealing with champagne and plastic flute drop-off as well as hooking up my friend Ken (ring-bearer and master of ceremonies) and Allison (professional surprise engagement ninja photographer) with uniforms so that my then-girlfriend wouldn't suspect anything was out of the lip-smacking, finger-licking ordinary. 

The photos speak for themselves, but the surprise went off without a hitch, not least of all because of the enthusiasm, whimsy and professionalism of Southern's staff. After the champagne was quaffed and the applause subsided, they even gave us matching Southern t-shirts to help commemorate the day.

So thank you Billy and the entire staff at Southern for rolling out the red carpet, to Ken Mao at Ful (www.facebook.com/eatful, @eatful) for being the master of ceremonies and Allison Slater photography (allisonslaterphotography.com, @allisonslaterphotography) for the amazing pics.

They come on some sort of French bread  (or Italian, depending on your neighborhood.) Today's PSECS subs came on a crispy-crust, French baguette: crunchy on the exterior, and soft/chewy on the interior.

Fillings are up to the customer who can choose from a list of hot, cold, wrap, or salad preparations listed on the wall and on the on-line menu. We opted for two simple, straightforward subs we order almost anytime we are trying out a new venue or chain. Unfortunately, what we received did not resemble the subs pictured on their advertising. Of course, frequently that is the case and accompanied by the disclaimer, ""serving suggestion."" 

The fillings were sparse...really sparse; but they were fresh and flavorful.  Nonetheless, it was  disappointing to get nearly twice as much bread as filling. (Compare/contrast my photos with the menu photos the company provides.)

Fries were mixed in terms of quality: Cut Fresh, yes; Fried Nicely, yes...BUT other than the few 2"" ones pictured on the photo I took and posted, they were little 1-inch pieces and smaller, hardly big enough to pinch between your fingers when trying to extract them from the cup-container. Flavor was good...at least from what we could tell with these nibbles.

The employees were friendly and courteous. The interior of the building, located in the corer of a strip mall, was dim and dingy (but appeared clean).

The scrambled eggs weren't fluffy at all:(  A few of us got scrambled eggs and they all were cooked the same. Not whisked and on low heat and fluffed. They were flat looking and not mixed well because you could see the whites still in the scramble. The place itself was quaint and cute with a diner feel. I would give this place a second shot but they gotta nail the basic scrambled eggs first. The front lady hostess was friendly and they had a young boy (maybe 12?) who sat us. He was sweet and attentive. 5 stars for the boy just for being a super helper :) probably helping out the family and he was a trooper and smiled while doing it.,2021-10-04 03:05:27,neutre,neutre

V1VpPXAmCa5v3OvbUgRDgg,Zz_kiItuvyCbcCIuBcAdxg,95zpH0vJtEoifBLsq8q0Cw,1,27,0,0,"Story highlights because this one is long: ""Her dress was not good taste."" ""Your dress looks better than that other bride."" ""You stand too comfortable. You should suck in more."" ""You're going to fall on your face at your reception."" ""You're a waste of my time.""

I went to Elegant Alterations yesterday to get an estimate on alterations to my wedding gown. The dress itself was just under $4000. With that in mind, I wanted the alterations to be done well, but also still be affordable since I spent most of my budget on the dress itself. I told Cathy beforehand on the phone that I wanted an estimate on my dress alterations, and she said to come by anytime after 4:45. I show up at 5 because I had trouble finding the place, and she is passive aggressive to me about being late. I just shake it off because she's right, I was later. Next, she tells me to put on the dress. When I come out, she starts comparing my dress to the girl who had been there when I came in (who I knew from college, but hadn't mentioned that yet) and saying mine was better and hers was ugly with no taste. I tell her that both are great, just different! I said her dress fits her personality well and she seemed to like it. She rolls her eyes.

Next, when she is pinning my dress, she tells me she needs to hem the back part of the underlining, and I tell her that isn't necessary because I am on a budget, and that part won't matter for how I have my reception planned. She continues to try to bully me into hemming the dress her way by saying, ""when you fall on your face at your reception, you'll think of me and know I was right."" Still I don't budge. 

Next, when I'm standing waiting for her to get something, she tells me I'm ""standing too comfortable"" and motions to my stomach sticking out. She goes on to tell me that I need to suck my stomach in all day on my wedding day because it's worth it on a special day. Cute.

She also quotes me on $35 per bustle, and insists there needs to be 3, which I now see from other past reviews that she was charging me $15 more than other people. At this point, I think she realizes that I don't have endless money to burn because I keep insisting on budget-friendly alterations due to the dress already fitting me so well (it fits like a frickin glove, it just needs a hem and bustle). Because she sees I have a price limit, she starts getting more aggressive and dismissive with my feedback and reminding me of all the more wealthy people she's done dresses for *name drops specific Beaman family members(who I also know and went to college with so that was uncomfortable again)*. 

At this point, I've been there over an hour (15 min of which she spent talking about other people's gowns and personal lives that I quite frankly don't care about at all and it's not my business who got a divorce), so I say I need to go and I'll compare prices elsewhere and get back to her. She freezes and acts surprised that I'm taking n my dresses with me. I remind her that I told her on the phone that I was just getting a price estimate, and she responds by saying ""lots of brides call me, that's not my fault."" Got a pen? Write it down. That's what our appointment was for, and I was clear about that. 

Next, she starts berating me about how I had ""wasted her time"" and she kept repeating ""MY time is money."" I say, ""I'm sorry if there was a misunderstanding, but I was clear on the phone about what I wanted."" So she starts trying to bully me (again) into leaving my dress there, saying all her pins and markings are already on my dress, and her pins ""are her money."" I tell her I'm sorry she feels that way, but I'm taking my dress with me, and pick out the closest pins to me and reach to hand them to her. She doesn't even look at me and gestures for me to put them in the container at her feet. I genuinely didn't understand so I said, ""do you want these back?"" And she nudges the container at her feet towards me, while I'm still in my fitted gown and covered in open pins. So I scrunch down, put them in the container and go change. When I come out, she tells me to hang up the dress so she can check for any more pins, and begins angrily erasing the markings she made with a wet rag. She does this for a long time in silence and very aggressively on my dress to make a show of how inconvenient I was to her, and I just stood there in silence and watched. I won't apologize for something I didn't do wrong and isn't my fault. I was clear on the phone, and she had been disorganized, rude, shamed my body, and talked crap about other women that weren't there to defend themselves. 

I respect strong women, especially business owners. However, I will not give my business to anyone who body-shames women, gossips to strangers about private business, bullies to get their way, is elitist about their clientele, or is just overall unkind. Oh. And she quoted me $350 for a small hem in the front, and a bustle. You're cancelled, Cathy.",2019-07-17 13:45:54,négatif,négatif

We got our rather simple drinks 40 minutes after being seated. My Belvedere martini was essentially water - it had either sat for too long or been shaken 20 times. 
The calamari was fine, nice and crisp, if not terribly hot. 
Our dinners were served after 8:00. My Caesar salad was soggy and flavorless.  The Fantasia Di Mares:  served over very al dente pasta, the unseasoned fresh seafood was tasteless, as were the red or white ""sauces"" that had been poured over them.  There was certainly no temptation to dredge your bread to capture the flavors. 
The New York strip itself was praised as very good. It is listed as being served with steak fries. Our diner requested those be replaced with mashed instead, for which we were charged an additional $8.   
Our two vegetarians enjoyed their Buffalo Napoleons.
This visit was apparently a lesson not to eat out large on a Saturday night. We've enjoyed this restaurant for 20 years as a ""treat"". Like most diners, we assumed Aldo's could handle their expansion. Oh well

Cons: 
-Waaaay too overcrowded at peak times. I'm not one to take group classes, but the rooms always seem overpacked with people 
-The place is run by children. They're all very young, and professionalism is minimal at best. I don't even scan in when I go because nobody is paying attention, and I am rarely greeted upon entry. Usually the kids are huddled around joking with one another, playing on their cell phones, or playing on the computer. 
-Next to the gym is a pizza place, a donut shop, etc. I worry that the temptation of the junk food is a lot to handle for some people, and I feel bad that they have to walk in/out of the gym with temptation surrounding them. 
-Not enough mirrors. The power racks are facing blank walls, so I can't watch my form effectively or efficiently. 
-High pressure sales for PT. Signing up for a membership was easy enough, but their PT salesmen are very aggressive.

     First the ambiance and decor are very unusual and make you seem at home in the bayou. They have 3 sections of seating sort of shotgun style. While we were in there, they were playing some Cuban music. Although they will play anything with a good beat. The staff is super friendly and always check on you to make sure your OK. They will also recommend the best po boys if you unsure what you want. And they will make sure you get it the way you want. Spicy or not. 
     Now the GREAT part. The food. My son who is 11 is very picky. He had a plain cheeseburger po boy. His mind was blown. And having it look like a po boy made him feel he was eating a Cajun cheeseburger. Nice move. My wife who love Roast beef po boys and knows when she's had a good one was very impressed. She may have left a crumb but I doubt it. The meat was tender and full of beef flavor. It really didn't need and gravy but the gravy put it over the top. Just enough to make the bread soggy but not falling apart everywhere which is a BIG bonus. A meat eaters heaven for sure. Myself had a shrimp poboy DA YAT. Which is a shrimp po boy smothered in Gumbo!. Man let me tell you, I was in heaven. The shrimp had a light breading and very crisp which is a 10 in my book! A medium Cajun flavoring not heavy so you can taste the freshness of the shrimp. Dressed with mayo, lettuce no tomato and pickles. My daughter who can eat lava with a spoon had a shrimp po boy WHO DAT, which is a spicy version smothered in Etouffee sauce. Again you can taste the freshness of the shrimp but the etouffee sauce was magnificent. Not to thick and not to runny. Silky smooth sauce that complimented the po boy nicely. And then to top it off the owner let us try there praline ice cream. POOF!! Mind blown. The ice cream was very creamy and sweet just like you want it. 
     So in summation, I can't believe it took me so long to find this place. I would highly recommend this place to anyone that wants a GREAT po boy. By the way if you take a food tour. This is one of the stops on the tour. Great place and great food. Must try",2020-01-07 19:48:31,positif,positif

This place was INCREDIBLE. Everything from the drinks, to the service, to the food was top of the line. My gf and I went on our yearly visit to our college city Philadelphia for New Years...and boy we were in for a treat!

Drinks - upon arrival our table wasn't quite ready so we grabbed drinks at the bar. One of my favorite New York classics is a Paper Plane (equal parts bourbon, lemon juice, aperol, and amaro nonino) which the bartender made fantastically. Every Paper Plane comes out slightly different and I have to say his was one of my top 3 ever...

Service - freakin' impeccable...if only I could remember our servers name! (Black hair, tattoo sleeve, 30-40 year old lady) She was INCREDIBLE, and made us feel like we were in her own home. We never had to ask for water/more drinks, the table was always cleaned immediately after finishing each course and she even helped me out with some of her own personal tea (I had come down with a small cold while visiting so this was quite amazing!). She even had the chef change one of the courses because it contained fois gras which I am not a fan of because of how it is obtained. Unbelievable. 10 stars if I could!

Food - out of this world!!! Very unique and interesting flavors in every dish, especially in the scallop dish. The technique and mastery of each dish that came to our table was extraordinary.

All in all the experience was one of the best I have ever had anywhere in the world! I will be returning in a weeks time when I fly back for the Super Bowl! Go Birds! Cheers!",2018-01-26 19:42:46,positif,positif

The process was fine, she informed me of the issue with my nails turning yellow which occurred from my last encounter at Nifty because the technician missed applying gel on my nails and I didn't notice it until I was gone...but I didn't come back and cause rage but moving along.

Issue #1 - As Vicki is using the nail drill, she starts twisting my thumb. I was trying to correct my thumb but she wants to inform me that it has to be painful for her to get it done; so it doesn't get completed because it HURTS! She then goes forward with her defense that she is not saying anything to me when ALL I SAID WAS YOU ARE HURTING MY THUMB! Didn't know if that would involve words but...yea

Issue #2 - As Vicki is applying my polish she has to use a UV lamp which she is throwing it from side to side as she finishes each hand, which results in a messed up nail because if you can imagine a person throwing something it tilts on my nail. I have her to correct it and she smacks her lips. I then go on to ask if there is animosity from (Issue #1) have one of your peers to finish. Her response is...no one is available (as I am looking at several workers talking and sitting at their stations). So like most customers I reference the boss can sure help me if you're being rude and Vicki says the following, ""Do you know who the boss is? I say no who is the boss and she says, ""Me"". I ask for her name and she then declines. So at this point I just stood up to ask for another worker, because I couldn't sit there and be taunted by The Boss herself any longer. So then she gets up and storms to the back of the building.

Thank you to the technician that came in to complete my nails and advise me her name. Meanwhile as the tech is helping me she is talking to another customer about me. (Really professional) Repeating she didn't say anything to me.

Unfortunately, this would not be the case.

I got Pomme's version of my go-to brunch fare: eggs benedict. Never fails to disappoint but Pomme's version did disappoint... a lot. First of all, they trimmed the eggs to the max and left solely the poached yolk atop my ""benedict."" Second of all, the bacon, which is actual bacon and not the Canadian bacon (ham) that's most often served with in eggs benedict, didn't complement the dish very well. Its crunchy texture made it hard to eat with the English muffin and the eggs so I had to eat it on the side, which was not how I had intended to have my bacon. Apparently Pomme is not a place where I can have my bacon and eat it too. Third of all, the wait was inexplicably long for poached eggs and a salad. Granted the salad had hanger steak on it but with how empty the restaurant was about 5-10 minutes after we were seated, the long wait seemed bizarre.

- Walk up window to order sno cones

- Delicious fries
- Good portions
- Husband loved the burger

CONS

- Kids grilled cheese was not good (american on white bread)

Commander's Palace fits that bill. 

We arrived early for our reservation, so we went to their small bar in the back (through the kitchen, escorted by an employee) and started the evening with cocktails. They were very insistent to take our time, our table would be ready when we were. I had The Adelaide Swizzle...it was one of the best mixed drinks I've ever had. I had a few more throughout the night, as well as the Crescent City Cooler which, despite the cheezy name, was ultimate refreshment in a glass. 

When we were ready, the bartender called the maitre'd and someone was sent back to collect us. Another short jaunt through the kitchen (which is always so educational!) and we were seated in the main dining room. 

The restaurant is beautiful; with fabric paneled walls, wooden chandeliers and beautiful wall paper. The tables are spaced apart just right; you overhear no one else's conversation. 

The menu is compact and complete; all the bases are covered with just enough originality to make it seem fresh, but not grandiose. 

The wine menu is overwhelming in it's choice and has many price points for all budgets. We went with a pinot noir that our waiter recommended, based on our tastes. We were both very pleased. 

I started with the turtle soup. Take me home and put me to bed; I still think about that turtle soup. Light and nearly citrusy but warm and earthy at the same time. Perfection. 

My main course was a fried soft-shell crab. Sadly, I didn't enjoy it that much. It was served with avacado and other cool vegetables and it just didn't seem to match the crab well. The flavors were off for me. My husbands infused pork was incredible. 

For desert, we went big and got the table-side prepared bananas foster *and* the bread pudding souffle. The table-side preparation was quite the show; fun to watch and even more fun to eat. It was extraordinary; perfectly caramelized, with just enough alcohol still left to give it depth. The souffle my husband wouldn't let me touch; he's a bread pudding fanatic and this was, apparently, the best he'd ever had.

You deserve to get scammed and lied to.  I am calling them out on their bull----!  We showed up on a morning we rented a 20 ' pontoon boat.  It was very foggy we drove an hour and 45 mins to get there.  They told us we couldn't go out yet, which we understood. However, our question to them was""why didn't you call us?  (It would had been nice to sleep an hour longer). They said we were waiting to see if you showed up.  We went for coffee came back and Austin said"" oh, for your trouble we bumped you up to a larger boat at no cost"" we said thank You and proceeded on with loading the boat.  Tim had about as much personality as a wall.  He spoke in a condescending tone as he made sure to ask each of us to wipe our feet on the wet dirty towel they threw done on the floor.  We rent at least 6-8 boats a year on the gulf since moving here.  My husband and I have been boat owners in the past, when we got together, we both had a boat and we took good care of our boats. You don't need to be a condescending messenger Tim. 
The boat was the worst boat we have ever rented, no speedometer, no gas gauge, no radio, no backs on the seats, no cup holders.  It was like renting a raft with cloth sides, no joke.
The positive for the day was the area, it was peaceful and tons of dolphins to watch.  Also the fishing was good. 
When we arrived back 30 mins. Early we unloaded the boat, used the restroom and went on our way(My husband finished dealing with Austin while I was in the restroom).  After being told they would drop the price from 250.00 down to 150.00 they charged us the entire 250.00 plus gas. If you want to go out in this area there are plenty other marinas to use.  Do not be scammed like we were take your business elsewhere.  Do yourself a huge favor.  Austin and Tim all I have to say to you is shut down your marina....you guys are a HUGE JOKE!

When I asked what he meant by that, he then asked what I ordered. After telling him my order, he looked around in the hot and ready section, then he yelled to the back crew if my order was ready. I assume the back crew said no because he never did give me my pizza and proceeded to help other customers. Other customers in the store said they had been waiting for their order for more than 45 minutes. I observed the back counter with pizzas sitting there. After about 10 more minutes, the young man looked through the pizzas sitting on the back counter and asked me what I ordered and my name. He then gave me the pizzas.

My mother in law is allergic to eggs. She ordered the burger and asked them to leave off the egg because she's extremely allergic. We said it 2x. Her burger came out with a fried egg on it. She said she wanted it well done, it was medium rare. 

I ordered the St. Bart's POACHED eggs. It came out with SCRAMBLED eggs on top. 

My daughter ordered the kids meal with pancakes and scrambled eggs. This meal came with a drink. She got French toast and NO egg. AND the server charged us an extra $3.50 for her orange juice!!!

That's just the issues with the ordering. There was no manager apology, and the waitress said she normally works the night shift which is why she got everything wrong. 

Ok so let's talk about the food. The poached egg was barely cooked- the yellow is supposed to be soft and runny, but the whites are supposed to be cooked. Instead I was eating a cold runny egg, and I could even send it back because my husband was already done eating since his order was the only one they did right. The croissant was soaked completely through so it was a mess. The hash browns were cold, so clearly they just used my original plate. My biscuit was heavy and floury. Yuck. 

My daughter said IHOPs pancakes tasted better. And I have to agree. These pancakes were not fluffy at all. They tasted like they were made with wheat flour. And the scrambled egg looked like it was made with powdered egg. 

The dad's steak special tasted good but it was a total rip off at $24. The steak portion was tiny. For that price, we would rather go to Ruth Chris and get a real steak.

I love their Peach Bourbon cocktail SO MUCH. I love bourbon, and the peach just gives it a spring/summer vibe, perfect for sipping on a patio here or elsewhere, to be honest. 

The bacon chorizo dates with red pepper sauce is one of the best appetizers I've had! You get 3 of them so it's a nice start to your meal without it filling you up before your entree arrives. 

I got the Honey Sriracha Crispy Gulf Shrimp bowl. The shrimp was perfectly done and just had the right amount of heat from the sriracha. The veggies were tender crisp so there were good textures throughout. My husband got the Cuban sandwich, and he liked it a lot, but he found it a bit dry. The housemade pickles were a highlight for him though. He said the sandwich could have used a bit more sauce (I'm not sure what sauce he's referring to though.) 

I haven't had the daily specials yet, but I am sure I'll come back and try those. Saturday it was the Cowboy burger. It's a nice change that their sandwiches come with simple salads instead of fries. One thing I wish is that they had a dessert menu. I have a big sweet tooth so I miss that, but I'm happy to substitute a peach bourbon for that.

It's basically a party in your mouth.  DEFINITELY get the Dan Dan and string beans (ground pork comes on both).  If you like cumin, the chicken is also good.  Not too spicy at all.

I ordered breakfast hash and inquired about the spiciness of the food specifically cayenne pepper. I was told they could leave the spice off.

The food arrived totally devoid of flavor. Not even salt and pepper. The server offered to take it back but that's a bit too late when you are trying to keep pace with your dining companion. And it's exactly the problem I tried to avoid by asking if it would still have flavor. 

There was exactly nothing to recommend about the meal for me. I hope this critique of service and food preparation illustrates that communication is important. Actually listen to what the concerns are when questions are asked instead of giving flippant answers without thinking. I'll come back but will try to sit at another server's station.

Well we were wrong, and very sadly mistaken, as this turned out to be a less than celebratory place to have a Birthday dinner.

We ordered a lamb entrée and a salmon entrée.  The salmon was dry, and the lamb was OK, but the sauce was so greasy and salty that it was a shame to waste good lamb.  The potatoes were limp and tasteless, I felt they had been left over from the breakfast service.

We ordered a white wine, which was way overpriced, but hey this is a big hotel, and the money is always made on the wine and spirits, but 50 bucks for a bottle of New Zealand white wine, was very much on the pricey side.  Plus it was not served in a cooler, and this wine needed to be served ice cold for it to be good.

When we complained about our meal, they were very nice, they did take the cost of the lamb off the bill, but they also wanted us out of there so quickly they almost brought us the bill before we had telling them about our meal.  On top of that, since we were two males, they asked if we wanted separate checks.  When we said we wanted coffee, they brought us coffee (which was not so great either, but that may have been my taste buds from the greasy meal, and then we waited and waited for them to bring our check.

We did go in the next morning for the breakfast service, which was very nice, but nothing remarkable.  It was a big hotel breakfast buffet.

Thank You!), or go treat myself to a belly full of a hot breakfast. Well I must admit that my stomach whining protestingly at just coffee I decided there was no better place to go than Sabrina's.

I have been there before on the weekend, so I know the wait can seem grueling. Knowing that it is such a popular place though I always find that calling before I leave the house to get on the waiting list really helps.

However this day was a weekday so I took my chances at not calling. I arrived at 9:30am and walked in to a mostly empty setting. Now since anytime I have gone before I've sat outside this was the first time I pierced the inner sanctum. It is actually quite large inside as the separation of dining areas makes for a deceiving outer appearance. When one of the servers saw us modestly peeking around a corner she happily ushered us into the hustle and bustle of the main (that day) breakfast nook. We sat down at one of the tables for two. And I have to say this was the only time I felt a little nervous. You see I am a bit clumsy ( okay a lot) and the confines of the claustrophobic table set me a little unease. The table had a bowl for creamers, a bowl for butter, sugar dish, ketchup, hot sauce, salt, and pepper. I understood the necessity so anytime my dining partner wasn't looking I just slowly pushed it closer to their side of the table.

Our waitress was prompt and bubbly just like a freshly squeezed orange juice and a fresh pot of coffee. I felt that this was the way that all of us should feel that early in the morning. Her service throughout our meal was impeccable and we left an extra big tip! 

Walking in I all ready knew what was to be ordered. I had coffee, Blue Cheese Frittata, Stuffed Caramelized Challah French Toast, and a side of scrapple (we decided to just split  things). The waitress brought out our delicious smelling meal and I was eager to devour as much as I could. They went so far as to even split the dishes in half for us! That was terribly convenient! This way there was no envious grumbling as one of us scarfed down one plate while the other looked on menacingly. The frittata was a giant fluffy slice of goodness. It has spinach, mushrooms, and bacon in it, along with blue cheese. Every bite was scrumptious and delicious. It was not dry (which I hate). The french toast is stuffed with banana and a farmer's cheese (which I find similar to a danish filling but, way better). The vanilla maple syrup is poured on at the perfect amount, not to little but, not drowning the entire dish either. The bread used is the largest I have come across, and I have seen giant Texas french toast in my day! It is a sweet taste for the breakfast enthusiast. I savor every crumb!

Even with two voraciously hungry people chipping away at the tasty delights, there was no way either of us could finish. The waitress gladly wrapped the rest of it up for us. Our bill was under $25 which for the portions and unrivaled taste I am more than accepting to pay. I really think that is a great bargain for great food, great service, and a great atmosphere!",2008-03-02 05:13:41,positif,positif

We have been on quite a few wine tours, including wine tours in France, and this was easily the best wine experience we've had by far. I wish we can rate this higher than a five!

If you haven't been to the Santa Barbara area to do wine tasting, go now! Also, if you are thinking of heading out to the wineries on your own, you will be missing out on so much by not going on a guided tour. The Sustainable Vines Wine Tour will guide you through the Santa Ynez Valley in a way that is literally impossible to do outside of a tour. Scott, our tour guide and certified sommelier, has a vast knowledge of the local wine and his connections with area wine makers and vineyard owners make for a truly unique experience.

Here was our day's itinerary: 

Pick up in a super classy Mercedes touring van at 10:00am in downtown Santa Barbara. Sustainable Vines will pick you up from a variety of areas in the Santa Barbara region. The van proceeded to pick up seven other tour group members, for a total of nine in the group. Your lunch choices of sandwiches or salads from a local Santa Barbara eatery will be in stow.

Our first stop was a small private winemaker near  Buellton. This is not a winery stop that you would be able to make on your own. Scott has connections with the proprietor and wine maker. We tried about six or seven of their  wines -- all were superb. We preferred the Chardonnay and Cabernet Franc. 

The next stop was another private Vineyard. The Petite Sirah, in particular, was exquisite. We also dined on our lunch at an idyllic setting on top of a hill overlooking the vineyards. Truly perfect!

On our way to our third and last stop we took a detour and stopped at a local lavender farm. Again, amazing!

The last stop was Demetria Estate. Incredible views and fantastic wine. Scott also knows the vineyard owners and we were able to chat about the wines and have a tasting experience not available to others stopping by the vineyard. 

On our way back to Santa Barbara, Scott played the movie ""Somm"", which is a documentary about the sommelier business. It was a great way to pass the time on the ride back to the hotel. 

In sum, you will have a few options to choose from for wine tours in the Santa Barbara area. Honestly, this should be your first, second, and only choice. With Scott's knowledge combined with the unique experiences, you will have a fantastic story to tell and memories for a lifetime. 

Enjoy the Santa Barbara wine!!!",2016-02-12 02:36:27,positif,positif

Tomato bisque & the BBQ chicken sammy are usually my go-to's. That, or the grilled cheese with all of the extras added. With the sandwiches come salad that is TO DIE FOR. The dressing is so delicious & will most likely win anyone over who isn't usually excited about greens. Not to mention the dried cranberries--yum! Last, but not least, the cute little house-made cookie that comes with each plate is the perfect ending to a delicious meal. I love that you can sit inside to enjoy the artwork & great music, or you can sit outside to enjoy the Reno Midtown atmosphere & sunshine. On top of everything, the staff is incredible, the table holders that have street names are adorable, & I have never encountered anything less than an immaculately clean environment.

She did bring the menus after cleaning the table so that was good.  She took our orders, and brought our drinks and food.  That's when we noticed we had no silverware.

My daughter, who loves burgers, didn't even eat her burger (it was well done, I made sure of that).

Their menu is pretty big but I noticed that a lot of their rolls had a fried or partially fried element to it so I steered clear of those since I like raw rolls.

Though it was a surprise to us, I loved the family cooking and sitting vibe.  We got there late on a Tuesday night, so there was a table open for the 4 of us, some random tourists later joined us. 

There's no menu here. They just bring out bowls of EVERYTHING they make for the night. They told us this after thy had brought out the corn bread and biscuits. Again, had I known this from doing my research on yelp, I would have skipped the bread...though I don't think that would have saved me from the glorious food coma I was in later.

Next came the hot food: fried chicken (one of the best ever), veggie lasagna (could have skipped this), beef stew (the best I've had), mashed potatoes, green beans, their famous corn pudding, cannelini beans and turnips. I tell ya, I was in heaven and in pain at the same time. Amazing. Delicious. Real southern home cooking, at its best.

After this was dessert, which for the night I was there was peach cobbler. Can't comment on it personally as I didn't have room to try it. My coworkers seemed impressed with it.

There was the perfect amount of fig jam spread on the bun such that I tasted the hint of sweetness in every bite but that it didn't overpower the burger. The bacon and caramelized onions also added a lot to the burger! Of note, I opted to get the burger without the bleu cheese as it's not really my favorite cheese. 

-Short rib benedict - Exactly what I imagined. Short rib was tasty, soft, and tender. I thought that there was too much hollandaise for me drenched over the benedict and that it was quite oily but all in all, still enjoyed it. The poached eggs were perfect. Home fries on the side was not crispy enough on the outside nor seasoned enough which I was sad about. 3.5 stars for this dish and not sure if it's worth the $18.5.

The chef was very attentive, as was the server. We never were kept waiting there at the bar, although it was pretty empty.

There are a couple of big tv's there with the NBA Finals playing. The place began to fill up as we were leaving. I was hesitant to come here, as my experience in this same building back when it used to be Sushi 7 was very disappointing. 

The chef asked if we wanted to try the sea urchin. Well we did, I am not a fan at all!! It's a brownish colour with the consistency of yogurt, and it tasted like what you might scoop out of the bottom of a fish tank. Actually it tasted like the ocaen, but super strong. It's a very pungent flavour that stay with you. Try it if you dare!! I thought it was cool that he offered us something unusual though. 

Try the:

Kitzmo Godzilla (Deep Fried) - Cream cheese, godzilla roll with spicy crab on top, habanero sauce, teriyaki sauce

Double Crunch - Tempura shrimp, cream cheese, avocado, tempura flakes, sweet mayo, teriyaki sauce

Picoso (Deep fried) - Tempura shrimp, crab, cream cheese, jalapeno, cilantro, habanero, teriyaki sauce

No problem, well maybe not for them, but for me, paying extra for one tissue thin layer of hard salami and I do mean one tissue thin layer well spread out and never over lapping and another of the provolone, what gives with that and the ends of both sides of the hoagie had no ham in it!

Since becoming neurotic about my chicken it's been very difficult to stop somewhere and get some clean healthy chicken to eat on the run. I read about Rotisseur when they first opened and I saw that they use Pennsylvania chickens but I couldn't find if they were cage free and untreated. 

Today I forgot my lunch and there was only one thing I wanted and you know I ain't talkin' about falafel. I figured I'd look at Pure Fare and maybe Honeygrow, but in the back of my mind I was thinking man I wish Rotisseur was good to go. Decided to pull up the menu and bam, all natural, antibiotic, cage, and hormone free Amish chicken. It was the answer to my prayers (and clearly printed on the menu).

Cruised on over, ordered a half chicken, it was ready in like five if that. Got some cups of hot sauce and was back at my desk, 15 minutes round trip.

jCDkCuDl_xhO2_5VIhuI7g,hD1RnUamcEILSvOG2F7peQ,49QeUC0W3mGJTxmg-bECTA,3,4,2,0,"I went in for happy hour and have to say, it's pretty legit! Got there a little after 5 pm on a Thursday and had no problem finding seating. Booths are pretty limited but the chairs were fairly comfortable. Happy hour consists of half off drinks AND appetizers. This makes me happy because so many places cheese out on their happy hour offerings by only taking a dollar off...if I'm happy with your happy hour, I'll come back at other hours too!

My friend and I had the malbec (there were two, we went the cheap route) and it was decent. Worth $3.50 a pour easily. The food was also pretty tasty. The pretzel was GIANT, warm, and covered in salt...a little too much for my liking, but it was easy to scrape off. What got me all tied up in knots about this dish was the 'beer cheese' for dipping. Let me just warn you - do not expect some kind of ooey, gooey cheese. This stuff was dry and very difficult to spread. The odd taste and funky texture did not enhance the pretzel in any way. It was almost reminiscent of space food...if I was on an interstellar journey and not in Boise, I would have probably enjoyed it. However, I opted to just eat my salty pretzel without it. We also got the onion petals and my mind instantly thought of a blooming onion esque dish. What came out were what could really be described as petals - an overflowing dish of thick onion slices, perfectly coated in batter and deep fried. This made such a huge difference because every piece tasted delicious. The accompanying dipping sauce (I think it was ranch) really worked. We ate the whole plate!!

I will say, I was disappointed in the service. When we first got there, things were not super busy, the restaurant was halfway full. Our waitress did not seem to be entertained from the moment she stopped by our table. Maybe my opening with a SELF deprecating joke was the wrong choice. Usually if I go out, I like to lighten the mood to begin with so the wait staff knows my table is easygoing and they are free to joke with us too! Not the case here. This girl seemed like she wanted to avoid our table at any cost, and in fact, she was successful in doing so. It easily took her 20-25 minutes to check on us after bringing out the food, only to ask if we wanted more drinks. Well, if she had checked 10 minutes prior and it was still happy hour, yes, we had planned on getting another round of drinks. But the fact that negligence on her part resulted in it being past that time, we did not feel it justifiable to pay the full price. Instead we just said we would like some ice waters (no, it was never offered to begin with). When she came back with the waters, she slammed them down. I thought maybe I was just imagining things, but my friend even turned to me and was shocked at how rude a gesture that was. If it was an accident, I would think the waitress would have apologized for making so  much noise. Instead she just turned on her heel.

All in all, this place is pretty cool and the owners really opened it up. It's a lot more lively than Table Rock was, although I do miss the giant Hopzilla cutout. I'm really excited to come back and try their veggie burger and fries (they had so many options that all sounded AMAZING). Not to mention all of the different sauces!

1) the ice cream was ""tasty"" and enjoyable. I didn't find it creamy. As I said in my previous review, it am more of a traditionalist when it comes to ice cream, and Scoop won't be on my list of choices in the future. If in Center City Franklin Fountain, Big Gay, or Bassett's would be my first choice. Outside of Center City I'd choose Handel's, Weckerly's, or Little Baby's. Lots of other places come to choose from, but these are some of my favorite. 

2) I didn't appreciate the colors of the ice cream. Personal preference for sure, but they were bright and unappealing to me. Again, personal preference. 

3) I don't remember a chocolate flavor among the options!

4) Again, totally my preference, but I didn't care for the menu (it was overwhelming to me). For example, the manager said in their feedback to my first review that I could have ordered a scoop. While it may have been an option, it didn't seem like the kind of place where one just got a scoop and the menu clearly didn't lead me to that choice. 

5) The staff was certainly friendly. 

6) I stand behind my three-rating. Others may very much disagree with me, and I can very much appreciate that. This is my informed opinion.",2019-08-31 16:35:23,neutre,neutre

This place just made us feel so cool for some reason and I laugh thinking about how we would order coffees and try to act all hip and haughty.  We must've looked painfully obvious, but at the time it was such a thrill.  That being said, I still loved visiting J J's when I moved back to Nashville for college and still do today.  

Although it is no longer a regular haunt of mine, I still enjoy stopping in here from time to time.  J J's is such a unique place, there is nothing like it in Nashville.  It is labeled as a Market and from the outside, looks to be just that.  The exterior is that of a boring, typical corner store and tricks you into thinking it'll hold the regular types of market merchandise, ramen and toilet paper and other generic products household products.  But entering J J's you find a much more tasteful and exciting selection of domestic and imported wares.  There's a large stock of higher end chocolates, in more varieties than you would expect.  They sell a surprisingly good selection of teas (lots of loose leaf yum) and coffees, some local, some not.  And an eclectic mish-mash of higher end grocery items.  Now granted J J's is small so their collection is not too incredibly extensive, but it's a great place to stop and pick up some odds and ends on the way home.    They also have a decent selection of cold beer, a lot of nicer breweries you can't find in your typical corner market and the sell kegs as well.  

What sets JJ's apart from other places isn't their amazing taste in merchandise, it's the atmosphere.  The market is only half of what makes up this place, my favorite part of JJ's is their 'lounge' area.  If you walk past the front counter you enter the back room which is a cozy little area filled with worn in chairs and tables.  On this side of the store, the front counter is turned into a coffee bar, where you can order a delicious version of your favorite coffee drink.  The 'lounge' is stocked with battered board games and reading material, and spending time here feels more like hanging out at a friends house than a local business.  I love meeting up with a couple friends here, grabbing a coffee and relaxing, playing one of their games or just chit chatting quietly.

The staff here are some of the friendliest in town and are always ready to help in anyway they can.  The prices are a little high but not more than expected as most of their merchandise can be hard to find anywhere else in town.  Their location on the Vanderbilt side of Broadway is in very convenient walking distance to a lot of hotels if you're a visitor, dorm rooms if you're a student, and lots of local businesses including music row, if you're looking for a spot to stop for a coffee break or an informal meeting.  This convenient walking location also means it can be a terrible parking location.  Spaces are extremely limited close by and on busy times of the day, you will probably spend more time looking for a spot than you will drinking your coffee.",2009-01-20 22:17:52,positif,positif

Pignic was part of the Out & About Pride Party and they concocted a sweet and tart cocktail that sounded super interesting. They called it the Rainbow Sure-bet, a little play on words that brought the biggest little city and the flavor of the drink, which tasted like that classic non-dairy frozen treat!

The drink was colorful and well balanced, plus garnished with some rainbow fun. They used 10 Torr vodka and infused it with rainbow sour candy for the base, then mixed it with some blood orange and bartender magic, and viola, delicious. 

The bartender was very quick with the cocktails and super efficient too. There weren't really too many patrons around when we stopped in, but dang she was fast and every drink came out the same, just as it should.

I almost completely walked by the cafe huddled under my umbrella last night, tucked into a quiet corner shop in the midst of the neon and noise of the Italian market.

The couches are well worn in, the fireplace was sadly fake, and if you're ever not sure which country the owner's from just look on the ceiling. The bathroom is also a must see, with a kind of red light, boudoir feel.

I got the Dirty Volcano to start off with, and enjoyed Rene's finesse while mixing the drink as much as drinking it when he was done.

I ate at this place later in the night so I did not have to wait in any line at all...yet, there was still a pretty long wait between the time I ordered and the time I actually got my food. During that long time I had the time to think about a lot of things, including how good that food must taste after all the hype and the time it took to prepare it.

and boy was I let down. To be fair, I did not order one of the more fancy items on the surprisingly short menu- I ordered some tacos. When the tacos were finally prepared, however, I just saw some meat on some tortillas...I thought, ok, maybe the meat/tortillas tastes amazing. After the 5 mins it took me to finish the 2 orders of tacos I ordered, I thought, wow...how did this place get such good reviews? Everything about the place/food was mediocre at best.

Normally, I would be a fan of simplicity but the food has got to be top notch at the simplest level. I can't say that the beef and tortillas tasted anything different than what I have had at any other restaurant. That said, I've also gotten a lot more at other mexican restaurants.

Our normal AYCE sushi place is Sushi Ai on Dorsett, and that we didn't want to go that far on an icy night.   Goodness, were we disappointed!   First of all, the tiered pricing system for AYCE is difficult to follow.  Yes, you can get AYCE for around $22, but the selections are so limited, I can't imagine anyone who loved sushi enough to order unlimited pieces would ever settle for tier 1.  Tier 2 is around $28, and has a decent selection of rolls, but hardly any nigiri pieces.  To get the REAL nigiri (tuna, salmon, yellowtail etc) you have to pony up $35 for the third tier.

We settled on tier 2 and figured we'd stick with rolls. We each proceded to order several different types of rolls, when the server informed us about their draconian rule of limiting AYCE orders to 2 rolls per order.  He said we were free to order as much as we wanted, but only TWO ROLLS at a time. So that's what we did -- and suddenly it made sense why they offered an AYCE deal.  You see, the time between deliveries averaged around 20 minutes.  So we'd order two rolls each, wait for delivery, eat, order two more, then wait - and after about two hours, we'd only had about three rounds.  I did a quick calculation, and realized that if we'd placed the exact same order a la carte, we would have saved money.

The sushi itself was pretty decent, and to their credit, they did have some very interesting roll combinations.  But they are not good enough to be as expensive as they are - and they're too expensive to hold their clientele to such strict rules.
We will go back to our standby out west and pay less than $20 for a REAL all-you-can-eat experience at Sushi Ai.",2012-01-21 03:04:52,négatif,négatif

I just could not comprehend why the floor would be slippery. It was not wet. 

Third, the burger I ordered was cooked as I asked- medium rare. It clearly tasted of beef and not overwhelmed with spices. The black and white shake was good too. But, the burger was super greasy, see the comment on the floor above. Maybe, it was the burger I ordered without looking enough at the description. I ordered a truffle burger. Then I looked and saw it was truffle scented mushrooms and truffle cheese. I could taste the truffles so that was good. All else on the burger was fresh.

Regardless, we went due to the colonial theme and were ultimately very disappointed. The servers all wore period costumes, but there was no attempt to ""stay in character."" The most interesting thing about the meal was the aluminum water goblets.

The reason this is a one star review was due to management. There was a very large party of 20-40 people on the other side of the room. Another party of 15-20 was seated behind us. This party had requested a private room and was told that they could get one. To their dismay, management felt that a large room with 30+ people was private. When they complained, they were told there was no other option.  Obviously this didn't affect us, but clearly revealed that this establishment targeted one time diners.

No microwave in the room which stinks cause we couldn't heat up our left overs or the popcorn we brought! The pool is on the 5th floor and has a view, pretty cool. The complimentary breakfast was nice but not many hot options; which is hard because we went and there was many people and TONS of people in line to make their own waffles ( which is time consuming 2-3 min to fully prepare each one) so the line seemed like forever. Only other hot options were eggs (blah) & bacon. Rest were muffins, fruit, cereal, oatmeal and such. But it was still good (&free).

The docor is beautiful and very down-to-earth and during those sunny and warm days, they will have the front open with additional outside seatings.

things i've tried so far:

STROZZAPRETI (pasta)- delicious! The potion is generous and with a hint of lemon juice in the mix, it makes the plate very appetizing and can easily down the whole thing no problem. This was completelly different than what i had imagined by reading the descriptions.  I saw the word ""Pesto"" and thought it would be covered in pesto sauce or something... NOPE, in a way the texture of each bite resembled that of a pesto pasta because of the bits of nuts.  But taste wise.. it's completely different! this has a greater focus on the mushrooms which i just loooove! and it really does have its own distinctive barbuzzo flavor to it.

Uovo (PIzza) - Another fabulous choice at the restaurant!  I usually never order pizza but I thought to try something new and the waiter said this is one of the most popular choices.  From the looks of it, it looks so simple and it really doesn't look like anything special... but wait till you bite into it! SoooOOoo full of flavor where certain ingredient stands out but at the same time, they also blend together in harmony.  The bacon bits and truffle oil are fabulous! and the runny egg in the middle makes each bite not too dry.  this is a must try!

Valentine's day menu - expensive and small! I was disappointed with the outcome... yes they did specifically say that they were serving the chef's tasting menu but i didn't think the portions would come out kid sized but with normal course pricing... We tried the love lettter riviloi and the pan seared sea bass, the love letter was good but not superb, after i tried the Strozzapreti, this one didn't stand out to me... 

the sea bass was delicious.  they left the fish pretty blank and surrounded with various garnishes that carried the flavor along with the freshness of the fish.  They had this orangey minced.. something pasta on top.. we couldn't figure out what it was other than we can tell there's a slight hint of garlic... but that accompanied the fish quite well.  this was uber expensive! for the small filet we got.. but the taste was awesome.  at least this one was justifiable. :P

A free $10 plate of crawfish was given to us, just because. Which brings me on to the food: The boiled crawfish was seasoned to perfection and was definitely one of the highlights of the meal. Otherwise, the shrimp creole was mouth-wateringly good and the gumbo was also delicious, tasting very authentic.

Waited for the newly opened buzz to die down, and hopefully the front of house staff to have their kinks worked out.  Made our reservation on Open Table, upon arriving a half hour early to have a drink at the bar first, when I checked in I was told to come up when we were ready.  After having the Dirty CEO- my favorite dirty martini w/ bleu cheese stuffed olives, I approached the host stand only to be told by a different hostess that now my table was not available and it would be a half hour wait.  We ordered another drink at the bar, saw people who arrived after us being sat 15 minutes into our wait.  I decided to approach the host stand again, this time speaking with the original hostess that said she had been waiting for me and has been holding my table.  Communication breakdown at the host stand between these two girls!

Once we were sat and approached by our server, we immediately ordered apps because we were starving!  We ordered calamari and the lamb chops.  Calamari was fine, the lamb chops were excellent!  For entrees, I had the Veal Chop Saltimbocca style which was cooked perfectly.  My boyfriend and the other couple had items such as the Filet and a seafood pasta which they described as nothing special, and there was a chicken dish that was just that, just a chicken dish- definitely nothing special. 

I would like to give this another shot as I really enjoyed the ambience and some of the dishes.  But, I will give them more time to work out some more kinks!",2012-11-26 18:02:18,neutre,neutre

I preferred the previous vendor due to the availability of vegetables without meat cooked in them. One of my biggest complaints about the vegetarian options is the fact they do offer a veggie burger; however, it is cooked on the same grill with the same grease and utensil as the hamburgers and other meats. 
  Also, there are many days when I would get lettuce from the salad bar, nearly the same amount to go with lunch I packed. However, the price they charged me would vary .50 to 1.00. Quite a lot for just romaine lettuce leaves. They never could explain the fluctuation in charges, other than it seemed to me the scales weren't calibrated from line to line. 
  The atmosphere was typical cafeteria. Clean with mostly friendly staff.
  The cost is fairly high for what you get considering there are so many other options downtown. They do offer occasional and daily specials but no state employee discounts. Expect to pay at least $8-10 of you get a meal with a drink. I often saw people pay $12 or more adding dessert or a salad.",2014-12-05 04:49:30,neutre,neutre

Nothing warms the soul more on a chilly, rainy day in Philadelphia than soup.  And Rooster Soup delivered.  

Being the foodies that we are, we tasted each other's soups and also shared sandwiches.  And everything delivered. 

First the Cauliflower Soup-- hearty and warm, the added nuts on top were a pleasant surprise when they shopped up in a bite (a sip?).  Then the Sweet Potato Coconut Curry?  Amazing.  The flavor was bright and light, but felt just like a curry - the coconut flavor was delightful. 

The sandwiches we had were pretty darn good, too.  Now, the waiter disclosed they were trying some new breads, so I'm giving them some leeway there - the bread for the chicken schnitzl sandwich was great, but not right for the chicken, it just didn't hold up to it.  I'd love to get my hands on a few pieces for an avocado toast with some over easy eggs though.  Despite the bread, which I only questioned because the waiter wanted our feedback, the sandwich was strong.  But the mushroom cheesesteak shown brightly.  The mushrooms and kale were meaty and very flavorful.  It was a great and filling sandwich. 

All in all, Phenomenal Soups (I'll be picking up quarts, I'm sure), good and great sandwiches, and warm hearts.  How can you not love a place that donates its proceeds to charity?!",2018-03-28 19:35:28,positif,positif

We dined on a busy Friday night with a 9:30 reservation for my friend's birthday dinner. It was crowded, but we were still able to order a drink at the bar before our table was ready and hang out on one of the couches. We were called promptly to our table a little before 9:30. (This was the earliest reservation I could get for a Friday night callling from the Monday before..so if you want to dine on a weekend probably best to make the reservation early).
The food is delicious and so are the drinks. Food is served by small plates and perfect for sharing and trying many. We had:
Lamb meatballs- They were good. Hearty with tomato sauce. This is a personal prefrence but the sauce was a little on the sweet side for me. I like saltier, garlic-y sauces...but suffice it to say they were eaten in seoncds.
Mushroom farro salad: delicious...balanced, gone in seconds
Smoked octupus pizza- so good. mozzerella, broccolini, almond and red chili. Great choice.
Brussel sprouts- perfect. roasted just right with garlic and chestnut streusel.
Diver scallops- I am a sucker for scallps and usually order if they are on the menu. These did not disappoint. Served with fennel and pistachio mustard. Seasoned and cooked perfectly. So lovely.
Dessert- apple pie...served in a mini skillet with creamy, butter pecan ice cream. This was so very good. Buttery, apple-y goodness.
We also had delicous, well balanced cocktails and great service. 
I love this place. It's not an intimiate evening, so if you're looking for a quiet dinner with a low-key vibe, this is not your place. But if you're up for a sweet menu meant for sharing with signature cocktails and great city night life...this could be it.

To be frank, the service here sucked.

  We came in around midnight after fringing, and walked up to the bar. We were looking for a table, and a waitress who was talking to some people seated at the bar (turns out they were all friends with each other) showed us to a booth. It was just two of us, and we were seated behind five noisy chicks. It's a bar so of course we didn't care much. Our waitress drops menus off at our table and actually goes to chat with the five noisy chicks behind us. They were clearly personal friends with each other, but we didn't care much. 

  She came up to us five minutes later to take our order. We started naming off a couple bulldogs and hi-balls. We had about 4-5 drinks in mind for the both of us to share. She asked us if it was all for just the two of us, to which we replied yes, and then says that we have to order each drink separately because ""that's too much alcohol in front you."" 
  ????
   I'm from the states, and that's not a policy anywhere. My friend is from Edmonton, and she had never heard of such a policy either.  We're at fucking bar, where there's an abundance of alcohol, with belligerent women screaming with laughter behind us, as well as a drunk old man who's dressed like he's 60 years younger than he looks, and you're worried about us? Oh wait, I forgot that the women are your friends, I'm sorry. 

  Anyway, we continue to order our drinks one by one, and she leaves us for 15 minute intervals between each drink, and every time she had come up to us, she gave us an attitude and it seemed like we were taking away from here time with her friends. At one point, the drunk old guy starts walking around and floating around at the bar, talking to the younger crowd, making them uncomfortable and whatnot. He wound up standing at the bar in front of a stool one chick was sitting in, but she had gotten up. She was standing near our booth, watching him, and contemplating with our waitress if she should kick him out. She then turned around to us and asked how everything was, and if there was anything else she could get us. 
  We were surprised to find out that she was actually the manager of the place. She was wearing a white shirt and a mini skirt and the only thing that gave her away as an employee was a walkie-talkie or something sticking out of her pocket. I mean, she was just sitting at the bar talking to the big group of friends. She was easy on the eyes, but she could at least identify herself as a manager with a name tag or something. Our waitress didn't have a name tag either, or I'd be calling her out on here, no joke. 

  All in all, it was ridiculous that it was one big gathering of ""besties"" and we felt unwelcome. We didn't eat any of the food cuz it looked terrible at the booth behind us.",2013-08-26 01:43:48,négatif,négatif

So much, in fact, that I've been 3 times over the past 3 months hoping that things might turn around. I've gone early, late and during busy times and off peak... but after 3 strikes, they're out...

Pros (more like- not as bad as the cons): 
1. The meat is fine, I could make something similar with some bbq sauce and a slow cooker (or pressure cooker). Sometimes it's lukewarm other times it's hot. They basically have 1 bbq sauce that is about as standard as a bbq sauce can be. And the portions of meat are pretty reasonable. (Also, to be fair, I haven't had their chicken, so you're on your own with that one but it looks pretty good). 
2. There's a store that actually sells beer next-door (which is absurdly hard to find in this state). Lot of interesting characters hang out there too so always something to see if you sit outside. 

Cons: Sorry, there are lot of them:
1. Service - oh my it's bad. The last time I ate there, we sat outside on a quiet Sunday night and I saw our waiter maybe 4 times. We ran out of water early on (small plastic cups - which is fine) and forgot to ask for more the one time he came to see how we were doing. About 20 minutes later I was able to flag down someone (not our waiter of course because he was completely mia) and she was kind enough to bring the two of us a single cup of water. I guess it was my fault though because I only said ""could I"" instead of ""could we"" have more water...  
2. Sides - First of all, I think it may be a joke, but they say their sides are 1/2 lb. Now I'm not saying I need a half-pound of baked beans or coleslaw, but to say you're getting a 1/2 lb and then have them bring out a tiny saucer is... well it's hilarious. I asked the manager/owner about this once, he told me they weigh everything out and that sometimes the broth in the collard greens weighs it down, so he'd ask the kitchen to give me a little more... again, we're not talking .45 lbs we're talking .1 lbs. Anyway, like I said, don't expect the 1/2 lb of beans to be enough for more than 2 people because you're sure not getting that much. 
3. Food - Aside from the meat, everything there is fair to bad. We ordered sweet potatoes this time and got chewy, partially cooked, room temp chunks of sweet potato... I honestly don't know how they can serve that kind of stuff and hope for people to come back. The potato wedges (from the first trip) were also memorably room temp and undercooked. 

I love bbq and I really hope these guys can get it together a little more. If this was any good, I'd be there weekly. If you've got a hankering for bbq, I would suggest looking within to see what else you have a hankering for, because eating at this place will make you wish you had.",2015-08-03 00:26:56,négatif,neutre

I'll start with the parking, surprisingly, no valet. I thought that was strange considering it was a wedding and the venue was on the first floor. It was quite an experience to get parking and not being familiar with the Cira Center. 

Cocktail hour was nice but lacked for sure in most areas. While the staff were mostly friendly, you could tell some people just weren't interested in working or being there. The horderves were village whiskey sliders, Nashville chicken sliders, veggie sliders, lobster rolls and Kobe beef. Now the eggplant was far superior to the variety. The village sliders I had (3) were all extremely undercooked. They were as rare as you can get before being raw. Biting into the Nashville chicken it was good. Seasoned well and just enough spice, problem was it was cold in the center. The fried eggplant was the best by far. Also cold but flavored well and a great texture. The Kobe beef were also very good but they were tough to get. The staff and the guests were crammed into a small area, it was extremely tough to get around let alone get a drink at the bar. As for the bartenders, they were good. They didn't know how to make some drinks and other drinks they didn't have the liquor.

For the dinner portion of the wedding we sat in the common area of the Cira Center. It was decorated nice and the staff was much friendlier and helpful. We sat at table 7 which was close to the door and we had a great view of the city. Salad was to start. The pickled onions were delicious. The ratios to lettuce and dressing was way off, my salad was dry.

For the entrees my wife and I both had the short rib. It was fantastic! Perfect size portion of protein. They were very skimpy with the potatoes. The asparagus was undercooked for my taste.  

The desserts I didn't take a part in. Most were your typical cream puffs, cheesecake etc. All looked okay but nothing stood out. It just seemed like there were so many missteps throughout the evening.
Lastly, the DJ. I'm not sure if he came with the restaurant but he was terrible. Everything was techno, no request. We were mid dance and all of the sudden the lights come on at 10:30, party was over and we left. No announcement or anything. Quite strange...",2018-12-04 00:36:31,négatif,neutre

They said they couldn't because the sand which was already made... which is weird, but I politely said okay and they added wiz on top. Took the sandwich back to my seat and began to pull the white cheese off when I noticed a HAIR!!! Not one... but THREE black curly hairs!!! DISGUSTING! My boyfriend took the sandwich back to the counter and showed the hairs to the manager who then replied "" Oh... so NOW there's a hair in it!?"" So rude and unprofessional. My boyfriend was obviously irritated by the comment and told him to keep the sandwich because he wouldn't remake or refund it. We sat back at the table when the manager approached us aggressively asking us what we wanted ""do you want a new sandwich, your money back, or what!?"" My boyfriend said he was just irritated that he implied he was lying, to which he denied... then the manager responded saying he was annoyed we were blaming the employees because they wear hats..... OKAY, I'm sorry but the hats only cover the top of their heads.. a person's hair doesn't just shed from the top.. to top that.. he continued with ""first she comes saying the sandwich was made wrong, then you come with a hair complaint, I think she just didn't like the sandwich!"" I had every intention of enjoying that sandwich even though it was butchered. We ordered cheese fries as well which were actually very good, but my boyfriend could tell I was frustrated and flustered by the manager and told him he just wanted a refund. To which he replied ""sorry we don't do refunds, I can only remake you a sandwich."" Which he just said at the beginning of his rude approach he would. He asked us about our receipt, which I had brought to an employee when I thought I got the wrong order and he threw it away.

From the outside, it looks like a typical Middle Eastern fast food restaurant (neon signs and photos of gyros/kebabs in the window). Inside, it is small and a little rough around the edges. It looks like they started to decorate and never finished the job. They do a great carry out business, but, it is also a great little dine in spot. Not because it's pretty, but because they have the other elements down.

What I like most about Gyro Express is the food and price. Everything is priced under $10. Most items are under $7.50. The Owner (former Chef at Natasha's Kebab International), is a friendly bloke. He is very passionate about his food and it shows! 

The Gyro meat (typical American lamb/beef combo) is put through an extra step after it comes off of the spit and is sauteed with onions and special sauce. It is so tender and yummy and is the best gyro meat I have had in St. Louis ($4.99). They have an unbelievable warm eggplant puree appetizer served with pita that is similar to kashke badmen-jun ($2.99). 

I attempted to nail the chef down on a name for this scrumptious dip (I could live on this stuff).  On the menu, it says ""eggplant"" appetizer and when asked, the chef kept calling it ""Afghan eggplant dish."" Low and behold, I Googled ""Afghan eggplant dish"" and came up with lots of hits. So, I humbly accept the name ""eggplant dish"" in lieu of something more exciting. 

Other excellent dishes include sambusas that are similar to samosas (2 for $4.50), and house-made ice cream with pistachios ($2.50). I have plans of returning to try other items, but I don't care much for the chicken biryani. It's a bit dry.

I order the Mexican gumbo, which is something of a misnomer because it's nothing like gumbo. They take their tortilla soup and ladle it over beans and rice. I find their tortilla soup much too spicy, so the beans and rice tame it down. You can add meat or veg, but I like it with just a spoonful of salsa. It's warm, filling and good for you.

I also like their ""naked"" salads (no tortilla shell). The burritos are huge (almost to the point of being gross). Chips have a hint of lime and are NOT too salty and in fact, I would ask for extra salt if I could. Maybe the problem is that the salt is unevenly distributed?

Chipotle is comparable in flavors but it goes through you faster, if you get my drift. There isn't often a line at Qdoba, but if so, it moves fast. If you go frequently, ask about the Qdoba card that gives you points for your purchases that can be used for future purchases.

The first impression gives a hip young feel but wait five minutes and the customer service is so awful it ruins it. The customer service is AWFUL. It is even intimidating to pick out a nail color because there are all these signs saying if you accidentally drop a polish that you have to pay for it not to mention it was $23 before tip just for a simple manicure (not gel)! The technician seemed to not respect the manager and they were arguing over appointments and tickets during the manicure. The manager was curt and didn't offer any beverages even though I had to wait an hour an half just for a manicure although I was quoted 45 minutes.

The food is packaged nicely and the containers are effective enough to ensure you have no spills on your drive home.  

Both my wife and I agree on the following, Win Win is a better experience for dine in rather than take out.   Allow me to explain:

- Volume:  The amount of food you receive on the to go containers is no where near the same you receive when dining in. Traditionally there is a nice ratio of rice to entree, do not expect this on take out.  Your entree size is considerably smaller as well, now realize that you are paying the same price for take out and dine in.

-Consistency: I ordered the Mongolian Beef with the house fried rice.   I have had this dish during my dine in visits and it does not disappoint. Quite different on my take out experience, the onion to beef ratio was well let's just say that I felt I was having an onion salad with a few pieces of beef (honestly less than 8).  They also drowned the onions with sauce that had an overpowered taste of ginger.

I gave this review twi stars because the flavor is still good.  Win Win, please don't fall in the same pit that your peers have fallen to, differentiate yourself from them and maintain the quality that ""initially"" drew us to you.",2019-07-08 01:53:47,négatif,négatif

Look, it's not a boat from the 1800's or anything like that. I believe it was built in the 70's or something. But you're in New Orleans, and these boats are a big part of the history and you should experience it to the fullest.

As a short 2-2.5 hour cruise, even as a local, it is worth the money. You can sit, stand, walk all over most parts of the boat, enjoy the sights and listen to the narrator. It's nice. They even serve drinks. VERY OVERPRICED drinks, but.... c'mon.

Don't bother with the food. For a seriously pricey premium you can take the cruise and get a lunch or dinner. I went on the Jazz lunch one time and it was just... meh. I was expecting a live jazz band playing some dixieland while I ate some etouffee or jambalaya or other staples like that. What I got was a piano player droning out modern day boring Kenny G jazz and a buffet of bland mediocre ""New Orleans syle"" food. SERIOUS waste of money. There are literally a dozen restaurants where you can eat in the immediate vicinity of the vessel, so WAIT and eat there. 

But like I said, the actual cruise is nice. I tell people to at least check it out all the time. Even if you LIVE here, you should check it out every now and then.

The first experience was good...the second, not so much and the third was when I decided to do this and really wished I could give it no stars. 

My husband who works as a welder had just gotten off of a ten hour day.  We walked in and were seated fairly quickly.  We watched for ten minutes as an older female server assisted a table who had gotten there AFTER we had.  I just assumed that she was assigned their table so we patiently waited for our server.  Several staff members looked in our direction but said nothing.

After the female server took the order of the table who arrived after us, she looked in our direction and threw us a disgusted look, mostly directed at my husband, who was still in his work clothes. She paid no attention to me.  Naturally as I was wearing a pair of dress slacks and a nice professional blouse.  Her look was so insulting that I stood up and we walked out.

There is no dress code posted.  My husband was clean but his work clothes looked a bit rough.

Exactly who do they think THEY are to delay our service based off of physical appearance?  The two times before, my husband was wearing a pair of slacks and a nice button down shirt.  The same female server was there both times waiting on other tables and she had glanced our direction both times and smiled and welcomed us.  The two previous times, when we were both dressed nicely, they treated us very well. This is NOT a ritzy jacket and tie required type of environment.  It is an Oyster Bar in the middle of a casino.  The two previous times we had gone in there, we had noticed that the other patrons dressed fairly casually.  Had we thought it was going to be an issue of my husband's work attire, we would have planned accordingly.  

The worst part is that after the server's offensive glare in my husband's direction, and our subsequent departure, not a single staff member bothered to speak with us or ask if there was anything wrong.  They simply let us walk out. 

There are two factors that would cause me to never go back to a business and write a negative review.  Those factors are:  (1) bad food and/or (2) bad service.  By the server's look of disdain AND the fact that the other staff members showed a lack of consideration for us, that particular business conveyed to us that we, as patrons or potential patrons do not matter to them because we weren't the ""attractive"" type of customer they wanted.  In other words, they prejudged us as customers, based SOLELY off of appearance.

I went around 3 pm or 4 pm -for a late lunch or early dinner- with a friend. We were the only ones there. We knew from the other reviews that we had to try either the bulgogi or galbi. This time, we opted for a beef bulgogi ($20.99) and the fried chicken ($23.95).

The fried chicken was not fried chicken at all. It more closely resembled chicken tenders. As a fan of KFC, I had high expectations for Arirang's KFC to rival Sa Ri One's. The sauce that came with the KFC was very good. The chicken itself was good, but it was disappointing to get only chicken tenders and have it be advertised as the regular fried chicken.

Next, the ""beef bulgogi"" was a catastrophe. Having clearly said, ""beef bulgogi,"" our waitress must have misunderstood me, because of a couple of minutes before she brought the dish out, she asked whether or not I asked for pork or beef. I clarified that I wanted ""beef bulgogi"" and she apologized that the chef made a pork bulgogi. She asked if this was okay as it would take too long to make the beef bulgogi. We already waited a while for the food for being the only table in the restaurant so that the pork bulgogi would suffice.

When I received the ""pork bulgogi"" it had no resemblance to any bulgogi that was familiar to me. It was not thinly sliced, and it was not sweet and savory. Instead, we received a plate of ""spicy pork,"" which was hard pieces of pork slathered in gochujang. I did not enjoy it whatsoever.

We did not touch the ""pork bulgogi"" anymore and instead finished the ""KFC."" We asked for the check, and I asked her to remove the ""pork bulgogi"" from our check since we did not eat it (except for the one piece to try) and we did not like it. The waitress became offended as if we should have liked the mistaken plate that was brought out to us.

She quickly communicated the confusion with the owner and Misook quickly came out. Both ladies told me multiple times to clearly order the beef bulgogi next time instead of ordering what I got. I repeated myself that I did explicitly order the beef bulgogi and that it may just have been a misunderstanding. I only said yes to the ""pork bulgogi"" because I was starving and didn't mind pork, but what I received was not only the wrong order, it was not even close to an alternative. 

Both ladies continued to argue with each other in front of us and made us feel incredibly awkward. While Misook finally settled the argument, she offered us a free item on our next visit. Although I expressed my appreciation, I do not think I will return to Arirang. Neither the food or the display of service and professionalism met the standards for what is supposedly one of the best restaurants in South Tampa.",2017-03-26 02:26:12,négatif,neutre

My daughter and husband both had a negative experience here. But with my air conditioner not working during the summer heat and our regular mechanic not being able to service my car for about 5 days, I thought this was a viable option.  Never again.

I dropped my vehicle off before store hours and was called once I was at work informing me that the mechanic who repairs AC would not be in the morning and he was unsure if he was coming in at all. I asked if my vehicle could be transported to another location since the mechanic may not be in.  He assured me that he would do everything possible to have my vehicle looked at.

I did get a call that afternoon informing me that the compressor and condenser were bad.  I was quoted a price of $1500 to repair.  I did not authorize the repairs and told him I would pick up my vehicle that evening. 

When my husband and I went to pick up the vehicle, it took 10 minutes to be waited on, then another 10 minutes to find my keys, then another 10 minutes while the clerk searched for the paperwork.  The manager was called to assist.  The manager searched, but was unable to find the paperwork.  He asked me how much the diagnostics cost.  Asking a customer how much  the job cost???? Couldn't that info be found in the computer?????

So....finally get my car into our regular mechanic (a reputable one). Condenser replaced and freon added.  Compressor is in good shape - doesn't need to be replaced.  Cost -----$500.  Yes, one third of the cost that was quoted by Pepboys.

The Market has relocated to under the Gay Street Bridge, so it is in a nice shady area.  Not as much fruits as vegetables as I thought they'd have, but again it might have been because of the time.  We did buy some tomatoes, red onions, and cucumbers.  The pricing was right and the flavors turned out fantastic. 

Tasted, then bought, some wonderful blue cheese from Birchrun Hills Farms.  They had some other very flavorful cheeses as well.  Will have to go back and try and buy some others.

Good luck getting a table. Why? Cause I have never gone here when there wasn't a 30+ minute wait. More often it is somewhere in the order of 45+ minute wait. But if you can go when it's not packed, get there early or figure a way to avoid the wait it is well worth it.

This is not a bar to go to pick some one up. Rather after you picked them up and decide calling them the next weekend take them here. 

The service has been great. The cocktails are really unique and the reason you came here in the first place. Expensive for Nashville yes but well worth it. And even though they don't taste strong, if you have more than one or two you will be feeling it.

Between the food, the incompetent bartender and the arrogant attitude of the staff from hostess, to the wait staff (Dominque) and ultimately the manager (Lesley) there is nothing to recommend this establishment.   You would do better buying a Stouffer's frozen dinner.

The night started badly when our party arrived at 5:30 pm on a Sunday.  There were many open tables and the hostess attempted to seat us at the one closest to the door.  When we asked for one of the open booths away from the door, she attempted to seat our party at the booth in the doorway.  Finally on the third attempt, the clearly irritated hostess seated us away from the door.

With the arrival, we were informed that the olive appetizer was not available, nor were they able to make their signature Blood Orange mojito.   When one of our party inquired whether the bartender could make an Italian spritzer, we were told he could.  However what arrived was not an Italian spritzer, but a watered down version of what he thought was the drink (our waitress later informed us he looked it up on the Internet).  When Lesley inquired what happened and was informed of the problem, she sullenly took the drink back to the bar and when she returned it was with a repeat of the same.  When the client informed her again what was wrong with it and how to properly make it, she argued with him.  

Things got progressively worse with the entrees.  My Caesar salad was the worst I've ever had (even hotel room service Caesar salads are better).  There were only a few croutons, the dressing tasted foul and the cheese resembled Parmesan, but only in passing.  Lesley was clearly irritated when I told her the salad was inedible and she walked away without even so much as an apology.  From then on we were marked as a ""problem"" and our service became agonizingly slow to non-existent.

My wife's chicken piccata was a simply grilled, tough chicken breast slapped on top of a few strands of linguine and topped with parsley butter and a squeeze of lemon on top and 6 capers; another inedible dish.

Finally in an effort to recapture the evening, the ladies tried to order wine, but when it finally arrived at the table after a 20-minute wait, it was the wrong wine.  At this point, we asked for the check, which came in at a whopping $101 for drinks, appetizers and entrees for a party of four.   There was no apology offered, no attempt to make things right, just an attitude that the staff thought this was our problem and not theirs.  Lesley even laughed at us, and the table next door who also sent back their entrees.  

So in short, besides the presence of good friends, the only thing that redeemed this night was the dessert we had at the frozen yogurt place down the street!",2013-08-12 12:23:37,négatif,négatif

Next get items you want to eat such as seafood, smashed meat balls or fish, veggies, noodles etc. Make sure the soup is boiling before you start throwing things into your hot pot!

Recently I've seen a bunch of new clean eating places pop up all over the place in the general rule of thumb is if you sell enough quinoa and rice and have food that is either organic or grass-fed you can call yourself clean eating.

It's more of a bowl place but you can also get some sandwiches there too. Generally you get a rice or quinoa choice and then you get a protein and then you can top it with stuff. I went crazy and chose the BLT wrap which was a hot and press trap that did not seem filled with anything unnecessary. It had lots of bacon lettuce tomato and actually had beans inside of it to which or something a little bit different.

I was excited to try the potato cakes to start. The flavors were good and there were tasty accompanying sauces, I just wished the texture was firmer and crispier.  The chick peas were good though and cooked well.  One of the sauces had a little heat which gave the dish some extra kick. 

We ordered the bread basket which had a variety of Naan but was pricey for what it turned out to be. Another dish that fell flat was chicken that lacked flavor despite the sauce coating and was on the drier side.

Lastly we had the lamb vindaloo. This dish had a nice flavor, the chunks of lamb were plentiful. I really liked the rice and appreciated the cloves found in the rice to give a nice aroma and spice.

I love the natural foods section. I love Whole Foods but live way too far from it for a quick stop...this little section has everything I need, even bulk foods. Except sometimes I forget its there and when I look for my favorite brands in other parts of the store and can't find them, I get mad (my fault!). 

As far as grocery stores go, it's definitely a larger, cleaner, and brighter. Same Kroger pricing as any other store. 

The only thing that bothers me is the produce. I am a big fruit and veg girl and I am often underwhelmed by the produce. For example, I've tried (and failed) several times to get avocados from this location. I've never come home with any that were that great. Typically, I have to run over to Fresh Market, where I am guaranteed a good produce experience. On the other hand, I do get some produce (blueberries, already cut pineapple, strawberries, onions, etc.) that is perfectly fine for WAY cheaper than Fresh Market. So, it all evens out in the end, I guess. And I can get 10 Fage greek yogurts for $10 at Kroger. Definitely can't do that at Fresh Market.",2012-03-11 00:51:31,positif,positif

unC0WzmxsymN3vpkUqb1qw,3QnoTcrxuafMCoTzW_AH7A,n09hgXTl3gsDo1lLDvHZGQ,5,19,4,14,"500th review! I have to make it a good one, right? There was one special place that immediately came to mind...the spot I became a Mrs.! (This is less about the history/tours and geared mainly towards future brides/grooms or anyone planning a special day/photos here).

Our dream wedding location was the gorgeous, regal, historic gazebo at Fairmount Water Works. For us, it was THE perfect ceremony spot. This beautiful structure overlooking the river, nestled between Kelly Drive and Boathouse Row, at the foothills of The Philadelphia Museum of Art, not far from the Azalea Gardens is very special to us... 

When we lived in the Fairmount/Art Museum area we took walks/jogs on the drive daily, ending here at the gazebo. One day, waaaay before we were engaged he said ""wouldn't this be an amazing place to get married?"" That's it! I was done! That's all I needed to hear! This was going to be THE spot one day!

-We wanted somewhere we could visit forever with our children and one day, with our grandchildren.

- We wanted someplace we would always have access to as we wished and a place we would be assured would never close. 

-We wanted somewhere with rich history and a place that held permanent residence in a city and neighborhood we loved so very much. 

-We wanted what so clearly was ""our"" spot. 

I jumped through many hoops to secure this location for us! He got down on one knee October 17th and I had to wait until January 2nd, which for an excited bride is an eternity!! 8am on the second freezing day of the new year, with a money order in hand as instructed, I was at the door of the Fairmount Park Commission up on Concourse Drive in Fairmount Park, diagonal from Please Touch Museum. There, I filled out an application and waited and waited....and waited, and yep, waited, all the way until spring hoping to finally get the thumbs up on approval!! (It was a very long winter that year haha) You see, they give first priority to charities and local organizations and won't schedule weddings/ceremonies on days when there is a regatta on the river. Being that our date 10-10-10 was oh so insanely popular to begin with, I had my doubts we would even get it even if there weren't events going on. I still kept the faith and we did get it!!! The notification that we did for sure secure the space was THE greatest news EVER! Actually, a real dream come true! Well worth the wait!! 

Important things to remember :

-The number to call for more information is: 
(215) 685-0060
$500 for the gazebo for 2 hrs $150/ hr for photos. (We never pay for photos. We're smart about the times we come ex: mid week, just before sunset. We haven't had an issue in 5 years) 

-you may not tie anything to, or alter the gazebo in any way. (We had a hand held chuppah.) 

-you will need to order your own chairs. The cost can be very minimal if you shop around a bit!

-you MUST have your permit for the space with you at all times! 

The most important part of my review however is this: NO ONE but the Fairmount Park Commission owns the gazebo and surrounding structures! PERIOD!!! If you google it, even go for a tour there, it would appear the restaurant which was then the Water Works (currently Cescaphe group) owns the gazebo. In fact, they will try to tell you you they own it! THEY DO NOT!! NEVER WILL!! This misrepresentation enrages me because it holds many couples and (almost) us from our dream wedding ceremony! We first hand went on a tour where we were told this. We already had our reception caterer booked elsewhere so we had no interest in the reception space. We were ALMOST conned as many are when looking into the gazebo and cocktail space! After a little investigating from an uber determined bride, we came to find that use of the gazebo comes only with reception booking was a lie!!! You do not need to use the restaurant to use the gazebo. If you simply want to rent the gazebo or any aspect of the Waterworks outdoor spaces, you can absolutely do this without booking the restaurant for your reception! We still run into many, many couples who look over the gazebo because one reason or another regarding the restaurant. Despite what it may seem, they are completely separate and always will be!! 

After moving from the area, we don't visit here daily anymore, but we absolutely continue to come each and every year for our anniversary. We play our wedding song, the kids run up and down what was our aisle, and of course, I cry! I LOVE looking through these photos of how our little family is growing year after year!

This is a truly beautiful, magical spot and we couldn't recommend it any more for a wedding ceremony or for special photos. The space is elegant and neutral, making for the ultimate perfect backdrop. It's definitely not an easy site to secure for ceremonies, but believe me, it's extremely well worth it!",2016-12-27 17:35:58,positif,positif

The hostess and our server were wonderful!   Friendly and helpful.    The Plow and Angel has a real happy hour!

The next morning I got a call and the lady wanted us to come in but I told her we needed to wait until my wife got back to work but she didn't seem to understand this concept. I told her we would come in when my wife went back to work and we caught up on some bills. Over the next week I received 87 phone calls all with voice messages asking when we were going to come in and look also I have 43 text messages from her asking the same thing.

I first walked into Fuku my freshman year, and they gave me a menu pamphlet. Now, it's my senior year, and we finally decided to try the place. 

We ordered some delivery sushi along with the tofu noodle bowl. As you would expect, the sushi wasn't exactly cold and refreshing when it got to my front door. But, I'm not sure if that's reasonable to ask drivers to bring the food in an ice cooler...

The sushi menu was diverse, but a little too many ""edgy"" choices for me. But, I can understand the appeal. 

It was pretty irritating that there were no plastic bowls, or anything of the sort, for the soy sauce when the food arrived. Only soy sauce packets (more on that later). I mean, if you're going to deliver sushi, you should put some effort into making it a similar experience as it would've been in the restaurant. So, just be prepared to find some tiny bowls in your kitchen cabinet to use for soy sauce dipping.

Speaking of the soy sauce... what the hell? Just buy Kikkoman instead of the terrible tasting generic soy sauces you provided. It really took away from the sushi dish for me. Fuku.

The tofu noodles were more like ""deconstructed noodles with a side of tofu and veggies drowned in ground black pepper"". Not very good. 

In the end, the sushi itself was very good. I applaud the sushi chef. The soy sauce, the non-existent bowls, the noodles, the tofu, and the flavor were all meh and/or bleh.",2016-05-02 05:46:10,négatif,neutre

I happened to find this studio online-the website is great, extremely informative, and you can even sign up for class in advance online to reserve a bike, which is super convenient (no need to arrive early to ""claim"" a bike like other studios)! 

As far as the classes themselves-
The instructors are great- they help motivate/push you, have great energy all around-just down to earth good folks.  Not sure if anyone ever experienced a spinning class that drags on and the minutes tick by painfully slow...but this does NOT happen here!  Whether it's a 45 minute class or the hour-thirty, the instructors have great energy and the song choices are an awesome distraction-the beat matches up with the cadence to help you gauge how fast/slow you should be pedaling.  The playlists choices are great, and I often find myself downloading songs for my own ipod after hearing it there.  

About the studio: It's super clean, and has state of the art equipment.  The bikes are in great condition- the Keiser bikes they use are far better than the traditional spin bikes found in most other classes. 

Whether you are new to spinning or been cycling for years the instructors are extremely knowledgeable and happy to help set up bikes, watch your riding form, etc.  

All around, awesome workout experience-I look forward to going every week to get in a solid workout and having fun while I am there too.

They opened yesterday (8/2/15), and when I went in with hubby and kids yesterday we were the only customers.   

My husband had a chicken chimichanga, with black beans, rice and salsa inside, deep fried and a white sauce on top.   He said it was very good.  

I ordered a 'house platter ' - a choice of meat, with rice, beans and tortillas on the side.   I chose the pastor, a slightly sweet and well seasoned pork.   Not spicy, but very flavorful.   

My preschoolers each had a plate of rice and beans (their standard at Mexican restaurants), which they happily assembled into 'sandwiches' with my tortillas.   Some bites of the refried beans had a kick, but not all, so they almost needed a bit more stirring.   

The owners also made us a pretty complimentary plate of chips and salsa.  I liked them, my hubby would prefer more of a corn chip, but it was good.  

Overall food was very tasty.   Atmosphere is very casual - clean hole in the wall painted in bright colors with sombreros for decoration.     I would guess booths/tables might seat 30 total.

 A Cajun place is the first of its kind in this area, so our hopes were high. New Port Richey and Port Richey is where restaurants go to die, either from the staff or the unfair reviews from the locals. I have spent a great deal of time in Louisiana and Texas over the years, so I will try and be constructive.
 Interior: very clean and well lit. They have a nice mural over the central area, but the walls are painted white and the overall feel seems a bit more industrial. The best way to describe it is the nearby restaurant ""Catches"" you will know what I mean if you've been there. I would recommend a more nautical theme, such as fishing nets hanging on the wall etc..
 Our initial impression when walking in was a disinterested hostess who barely said a word. When walking out, not a word. Nothing. Very strange.
 Our waiter was Shawn. Great guy and very attentive.
   Now for the food: the menu had either fried or boiled choices, but the the pairings were odd. Sausage was ala carte, which was new to me. Usually Cajun places include sausage with everything. I would recommend having more than one seafood item per steam bag, along with sausage, corn and potato. Again, just a recommendation.
 I had the ""Captains basket"" with fried shrimp and clams.the breading seemed under cooked. Not soggy, but not crunchy. You got 4 shrimp and 5 clams with fries for $13.99. Glad I wasn't starving. The clam boil my wife got was awesome with plenty to eat and great flavors. That choice is the best, but again, Gould have another seafood choice paired with it  in the bag.
 Now for the prices: the price point seems a little high for the area, which will probably more negative reviews. People in this area will always look for freebies.
 Overall, I gave it 4 stars because the food is really good, your wait staff, like Shawn, are good at what they do and I really hope this place sticks around.

The pants needed to be hemmed and that was the only alteration, the salesman said 10 days to 2 weeks. I've had alterations before and this seems like a long time especially since we are not near any holidays or anything.  Lastly, when we went to pick up the suit they said ""oh you didn't pay for alterations"".  $22.  I ask why we weren't told initially, she didn't know why.  When I have been with my husband he has never paid to have the pants hemmed on a suit.  They have some sketchy business practices...beware.",2015-06-04 20:41:16,négatif,négatif

This is my second time having rolled ice cream, the first being at Icesmile. I'm not sure if I'm just not a fan of IceBurg or if the rolled ice cream here just isn't right. You order and pay at the register then pick up your order near the back. For $7, there are pre-selected specials they offer, or you can create your own. 

I ordered a green tea ice rolled ice cream with oreo topping. The rolled ice cream here is super frozen. I think the settings on the plate where the ice cream was rolled were off because the guy who was mixing struggled with it. It was also very tough when I ate it. I heard one of the employees saying the ice cream is vanilla based then saw her mix green tea powder with the ice cream mixture. The rolled ice cream did not end up tasting like green tea at all. It was vanilla ice cream with a light green color. 

Judging from the pictures, it also looks like there's inconsistency to how many rolls you get per cup. There was a space in my cup that could fit another roll, but that's where the piece of Oreo and utensils ended up sitting. Overall, I would not order the rolled ice cream again here but instead, opt for an acai bowl. Hopefully, that would taste better and have a better texture.",2017-04-11 00:35:59,négatif,neutre

The fries were smothered in cheese, jalapeños, green onion and brisket. It's an extra $2 for brisket but is definitely worth it. I was also excited to see they had peach cobbler on their menu but sadly they did not have any on hand when we went. So I will go back once they open their restaurant on 22nd and stuff my face with cobbler and more BBQ. The employees were very down-to-earth and sweet. The food smelled so heavenly that we could not wait til we got home to eat so we ate right in the car in the Walmart parking lot across the street.

Literally I have never met an owner so dishonest and deceptive is DISGUSTING!!! Our initial re-pipe of our home was fine for the most part. When it came time to install our bathroom we ran into major issues. The team arrived and took 2 hours to install our tub faucet and shower head. We have an unusual faucet so we didn't think much of it. The team took a lunch break returned around 1:30 only to spend two hours sitting in their van on their phones. They came in once or twice mentioned they needed to figure out the sink pipes but didn't mention any other issues. When 4pm came to leave we still had no toilet installed and no sink. (Mind you we had company coming that weekend and we have 1 bathroom in our home- HUGE issue) the worker wanted to bill us for 10am-4pm - 6 hours of work at $134 an hour!!!!! my husband argued about how they sat in their car so they comped 1 hour. BTW in case you your wondering we paid for their 1.5 break!!!!! Yea we paid $200 for them to take their lunch break AND we paid for them to sit in their Van. When we brought up the sitting in the van he explained they where trouble shooting the issue of the sink. Sooooo here is the big issue they installed 3/4 pipes into our wall (that was now tiled) when we have 1/2"" sink mount. THIS WAS THEIR ERROR!!!! We had the faucet present at the re-pipe installation. Our GC literally told them the parts they needed to adapt the two together and yet they sat in their van rather than going to the store to get the parts!!! They explained that the reason they couldn't install the toilet was because they didn't have the ""upunor"" (pex-a) tool to install it. IM SORRY!!! BUT WHAT PROFESSIONAL SHOWS UP TO A JOB WITHOUT THE TOOLS TO COMPLETE IT AND THEN BILLS YOU HOURLY!!!???  The toilet was present at the re-pipe so they had ZERO excuse for it not being prepared. This is the shadiest business we have ever worked with. So when my husband finally spoke to a area manage he apologized and came Saturday morning to install our toilet at no cost. That we greatly apupreciated. NOW to deal with the wrong pipes in the wall. My husband spoke to the owner who proceeded to yell at my him telling him we needed to pay them hourly to swap the pipes that they installed incorrectly!!! So we not have to pay more to fix the issue that they did wrong. At this point we're almost wondering if they installed the wrong pipes to bill more hours?!?! Most well run businesses will take ownership of their issue and correct it at no cost to the customer (since they are the ones who made the error) but not this company. THE OWNER IS UNPROFESSIONAL AND SHADY INDIVIDUAL WE OR OUR GC HAS EVER WINTNESSED. let me recap...
- wrong size pipes installed but won't take ownership to fix and wants to pay for forchis error
- showed up to the job WITHOUT the tools to complete the job 
- bills hourly for their lunch break 
- sits in their van while still billing you hourly to ""trouble shoot"" their issue - which is really an easy fix
- also they didn't remove our cast iron pipe which was part of our job bib so GC did it for us... we didn't even make an issue of this but our GC billed us for an hour of labor to do it. 

When I called to speak to the owner he was mysteriously on vacation literally 20 minutes after my husband got off the phone with him on Thursday. I explained to his receptionist to give him a message that I felt homeowners needed to aware of this and I would gladly share my experience if he wasn't willing to make it right. Oh and fast forward a week and half their team did not allow enough room on the pipes for ""escutcheons"" so we now can't pass inspections! So here it my review. Because he never made the job right.

I've been a handful of times, and I'm already settling into my go-to routine. First, I try to go during happy hour to take advantage of their good deals on drinks, pizza, and apps -- hellooo, risotto balls! Weeknights are a safer bet for a shorter wait, but you can always hop on the waitlist via Yelp.

Pizzas range from simple like the margherita to bold like the spicy nduja (tomato, mozzarella, garlic, oregano, honey). Yum! I haven't had a bad pie here.

The pasta is really my jam, though. Go figure at a place named Pastaria! I've been all over the place with my pasta orders, and my advice is to order what sounds good. Whether that's a light sauce, red sauce, short noodle, long noodle, just with your gut, and you'll be in great shape.

And don't forget save room for dessert, or at least a trip over to their gelato counter for some samples or a pint to go.

Some free street parking is available, but I usually take advantage of the free garage below the building. Just a quick elevator ride away from the lobby, this is a great option when it's cold or rainy.

The first electric bill was $120 for 10 days but they didn't care. It took a lot of back and forth but eventually they replaced the unit. I noticed that our electric bills decreased significantly after the unit was replaced. I even took it upon myself to contact the previous residents and they told me that they had the same issue and stopped using the AC because they couldn't afford the high bills. I think it's funny that previous residents had this same issue but they kept playing it off like it was nothing. During the first two months we lived here the unit just stopped working on two occasions. After being able to show them how our bill had decreased after the repair they provided us with a credit towards rent.
While others seem to have issues with pest I have never had a pest issue. During my time here I have probably seen one roach (I also live on the 3rd floor). I have, however, had an issue with silverfish. Valet is a pretty convenient option when they want to pick it up. Some days they come as early as 12pm some days they come after 5pm. At one point in time I was served with a violation for having 2 trash bags in my bin (there was no glass or holes. I'm sure they were being petty). However, I have noticed people with multiple bags in their bins who never get served. On another occasion, I was told that I had my bin out too late in the evening. However, I have seen people with their bins out on non service dates. I am finding that I am taking my own trash out more now since the rules are so ridiculous and I can't keep up. The trash pileup on the weekend is extremely unsanitary. I noticed a sign once and that helped the issue. I also noticed that they have placed a dumpster in the middle of the street. I'm not a fan of the dumpster in the street as it seems dangerous and inconvenient. The sign seemed to be very effective so I'm not sure why they removed it. Although there are doggie bags all around the neighborhood there seems to be a lot of dry dog poop lying in the grass. 
The side gate entry box has literally been broken since I've lived here.

I had been inquiring about the process of an addition to my current lease since December of 2020. The assistant (Jackie) and I had a conversation in December that confirmed the individual would need to pay an application fee, go through a background check, credit check and meet the rental income requirements. We also had a conversation on January 7th, 2021 where I expressed to her that my current roommate had left (but her name is obviously still on the lease). On January 12th, 2021 I sent an email about an application for a roommate addition. On January 14th, 2021 I still had not received a response.
When I called on January 14th, 2021 and let her know that I was following up about the email she seemed very irritated. She told me she had nothing to do with it and that it was forwarded to the property manager. I advised her that I was confused because in the email we were simply requesting the application. She continued to reiterate the same thing and made it a point to let me know that the property manager had other task in his queue that are of more importance. I noticed the conversation going left and her anger increasing as I kept telling her I was confused as to what we were waiting on when we just wanted to fill out the application. Eventually, I took the initiative to say ""okay, thank you for your time"" and disconnected the call.
The next day the property manager (Strato) sent an email letting us know that our request was denied. He mentioned that the way that I spoke to the assistant yesterday was ""disrespectful"" and attempted to mock me in the email by quoting things that never came out of my mouth such as: ""Ok, I don't got time for this""--which I'm assuming is supposed to be his take on ""AAVE"" and a generalization that he has made on how Black people conduct themselves. 
They replaced my refrigerator three times in 2020. On Friday March 26th, 2021 I noticed a leak. They did not come until March 31st, 2021 to try and resolve the issue although I listed it of high priority. I did not bother following up between that timeframe as I was fearful of once again being painted as an aggressor.
The gym at this property has been closed since March of 2020 (however the pool remains open) but Debbie at The Preserve and Shaneice at Promenade confirmed that their residents at the sister properties have access. I'm convinced they just don't want to give us access at this point. I've inquired about the matter with corporate through mail, email and voicemails since September of 2020 when Florida entered phase 3 but they're an even bigger joke.",2021-03-31 20:14:36,neutre,négatif

But today, I have to be one of those people, and the reason is Focus Travel.

I've been making random forays into New York since moving to the East Coast over a year ago. I've tried all the ""economy"" bus lines -- Focus, Cash World Tours, Yo! Bus, Megabus, probably Bolt at some point. They all have one thing in common: they suck. The Yo! Bus was my favorite for a while because it had a nice balance between the bottom-dollar cheapness of Focus and the illusion of luxury that is Megabus, but then it stopped being a thing. On my last trip to NYC I guess I forgot how truly awful Focus is, so I talked my boyfriend into meeting me in Chinatown and hopping onto one of those classically shady, unmarked white buses. The ride would have been fine except for the loud-mouthed, day-drinking South Philly brohams who seemed only capable of talking about titties and Percocet for two hours. (You get some riff raff on a $12 bus ride, go figure.) But overall, it was fine, whatever.

The ride home was another story. First we stopped at the office in NYC to pick up the tickets we bought online (for some reason you have to get a paper ticket even if you pay online, what?) The first person we talked to apparently didn't know English, so we were waved on to to the next window. That person started speaking Chinese to my clearly Caucasian boyfriend, and once he got a good kick out of that, switched to impeccable English. Ha, funny! When we stepped onto the bus I think we both micro-fainted for a second. It smelled like a giant unwashed armpit that had been slathered in barbecue sauce and left to putrefy. The seats were full of trash -- bottles, cans, gum wrappers, dirty napkins, fast food containers. What little trash made it into the actual trash bags wasn't taken out either. I've been on a lot of uncomfortable bus rides, but this was truly revolting. I breathed through my t-shirt until I got used to the smell, and then tried to sleep the rest of the way, making as little contact with anything on the bus as humanly possible. 

At best, Focus Travel is a serviceable, no-frills way of getting from point A to point B. I've had a few rides where I was almost by myself, and the bus was relatively clean, and I guess I was like... sort of satisfied. But more often than not, the bus is just a mess and so are the people on it. In its defense I will also say that it is usually on time (which can't be said for its competitors, ahem MEGABUS) but no matter how cheap your service is, I would expect the bus to at least be sanitary. I don't need wifi or leather seats or a second-run Disney movie, but please at least take out the f***ing trash.",2016-02-22 03:07:24,négatif,négatif

We began with the Pulpo Galicia (octopus sautéed with lemon, thyme, and capers). It is a generously-sized tapas serving, and we enjoyed sharing it. It was a shade on the salty side, but the octopus was tender and very flavorful. 

Next, we had the Caesar Brussel Sprouts. What an unexpected, delicious surprise of a salad! The brussels are roasted, shaved, and then served as a warm salad in a tangy caesar dressing with pickled onions. Be aware, this salad is quite large -- plan to share it, if you're ordering it along with an entree! We split it between three people and each still had a hearty serving of it. 

I got the Moqueca de Peixe, a seafood stew served over rice. It has a tomato and coconut milk base, with chili oil for just the right amount of heat. I have the impression that it is made with different seafood depending on availability, so the exact ingredients may differ, but mine contained shrimp, mussels, and grouper. It was great! I found myself scraping the dish at the end, trying to get every last bit of the sauce. 

My dinner companions both got the Pescado en Escabeche, which again is made with different fish depending on the night; last night it was a thick, large swordfish steak cooked in garlic, lime, and white wine sauce, served with sautéed squash. Both enjoyed it very much, and had leftovers to take home. 

We finished the meal with the Mexican Chocolate Pot de Crème, a lovely chocolate custard spiced with cinnamon and cayenne.

The menu is rather small, but still manages to cover the old classics while bringing in some more adventurous dishes.

It was a delightful egg-dish with a beautiful beschamel - rich with a complex taste and many flavors that my regular-Joe pallete was amazed by. Everyone at my table was interested and dipped a piece of toast for a taste.

Also, and very importantly, The Cup has great Bloody Mary's. My schedule did not permit me to come on Sunday - when the Bloody Mary bar is open, so I just went with a standard. It was great as always. Still, if you can visit on a Sunday, the Bloody Mary bar has every blendable item imaginable that could be put in a Bloody Mary. They have several different types of blends that are great, but the classic always wins in my book. Still, I wouldn't have know that artichokes and blue cheese make sense in a bloody mary were it not for The Cup Cafe.

The owner can no longer operate any consignment business in Idaho under a settlement reached this week in a lawsuit filed against him by the Idaho Attorney General's office.  If you are one of those who got nipped in dealing with Renaissance, note you have until June 10 to file your complaint with the AG's consumer protection division.

Had I taken the time to write a review three years ago when I did business with the owner, Dale Corson, it would have been an uncharacteristically short one for me of thumbs down.  As evidenced by outcome of the Idaho Attorney General's lawsuit filed against him, it seems I am not the only one to have had problems with his performance.  I'll insert today's news article text at the end of my comments.

I came to do business with Mr. Corson as a result of a referral to him by staff at a high end and well respected furniture store in Boise.  A staff member had been to my home and seeing items I planned to dispose of recommended Renaissance as their 'go to' for customers to consign high end furnishings and shared that his furniture store and perhaps others also used Renaissance to sell some inventory items for them.

I am a 'trust but verify' type so to confirm Renaissance was the right fit I visited the store to see how it was laid out and noted some furniture store labeling on the Renaissance displayed items - although not the store that had referred me - and also higher end brand resales.  I talked to an employee there and I subsequently spoke by phone with Mr. Corson to set up the consignment agreement.  Because I was careful  in coming to choose Renaissance, as the chaos of my experience with this business evolved I was in disbelief for how it differed from the agreement.  Because I was diligent in documentation and follow up, I came out mostly whole at the end of my dealings with Mr. Corson.  But it was only for my diligence and dogged follow up across many months that that was so.  Others seem to have been much worse off and note if you are one you can file with the consumer protection division through June 10.

Here's the article: 

""Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden sued Renaissance Furniture Consign and owner Dale Corson in December. The lawsuit alleged Corson abandoned the store, which was at 1507 W. Main St., as well as two storage units of consigned furniture.  Corson also didn't pay customers for furniture that Renaissance had sold for them on consignment, Wasden said.

Renaissance Consign employees worked for weeks with the store's property management company to return the furniture to its owners,"" Wasden's office said in a news release Tuesday, announcing a settlement of the lawsuit.

Under the settlement, Corson must pay refunds to consumers and must get rid of the business and its customer and employee records. He cannot operate any other consignment businesses in Idaho. He also must reimburse Wasden's office for its fees and investigative costs.

If he doesn't comply with the settlement, Corson could have to pay a $50,000 civil penalty, the news release said.

Any customers who think they lost money due to Corson's practices should file a complaint with Wasden's consumer protection division by June 10, the news release said.

Walking into Lotus feels like pulling back the curtain of time time in all the very best ways. Though the restaurant has the same decor that it's had for decades, the place is immaculate from the koi pond with waterfall in front to the mirrored ceilings in the main dining room. Who knew that chowing down on Chinese food could (and, honestly, should) be such a gorgeous, sentimental, and intimate experience? 

The menu is huge, but I stick with my tried and true favorites in General Tso's and sesame chicken. Their dinners are massive, so you can count on getting at least two meals out of one. The waiters (dressed up, obviously) will walk you through each course that's included with your meal. Here's what my $11 dinner for one comes with: coffee or tea, crackers and rolls with butter, a massive, gorgeous egg roll with tons of sauces on the side, soup (wonton, egg drop, or hot and sour), pieces of sweet and sour pork, whatever main dish I order, fried or steamed rice, and ice cream. And an added bonus: they bring your main dish out in a large, pretty dish with a silver serving dome lid so you can spoon bits onto your plate with your rice while keeping the rest of your food hot. My favorite part about the chicken is that it's incredibly crunchy and the meat is always good quality chicken breast. 

The waiters are friendly, smiley, and helpful. They swoop in when you need something and make sure to get anything you need. They know their regulars by name and order and make dining there an extra great experience. Need I say more?

This really doesn't have the feel of a ballpark. It's dark and decorated like a carnival, kind of creepy to be honest!

I have been twice, once while the Rays were in the World Series and this past Wednesday night for a Yankees vs. Rays game. It's a poor representation of our baseball team - they need to build a ballpark for the Rays right next door to our awesome Raymond James Stadium! BTW.. why is it so far away and not in Tampa?

Before I went to sit in my seat I stopped for a beer, paid $9.00. Something I've learned about the Trop.... WAIT to buy your beer until you are in your seat. Apparently, you get bigger beers for $7.00 from the beer people walking the audience. 

I had a hotdog.... of course, I was at a ball game! It was okay, but nothing special.

Nothing  fantastic to report on our outdated ball park , sadly. I felt like I was in a dungeon and was happy to be back in the parking lot after the game. 

It actually makes me sad to write this way about the Trop. I wish I had better things to report. Unfortunately we do not have a choice on where to go see the Rays play... you go to this stadium or you watch them on TV.

If you are going to the game, try to park in another parking lot so you can get out okay, buy your beer from your seat, and buy plenty of beer so you have a really great time regardless of your surroundings.",2011-07-23 21:18:22,négatif,négatif

It's very family friendly with lots of food items, a mocktail menu, and even a area with a big screen tv to entertain the small kiddos while you eat and drink your adult drinks.
The food menu is super solid with wings, pizza, salads, pretzels, poutine, and garlic fries. I really enjoyed all the food I tried. The Pearfection pizza toppings were delicious. My only suggestion would be to make a sturdier crust or lighten the load because I had to eat it with utensils. Not a bad problem to have though! We tried 3 styles of the wings and all enjoyed them, although I prefer ""wet"" vs dry, but they did provide sauce on the side.
The poutine had moist short rib and a good gravy, just hit me with some more cheese curds. I can never have enough cheese curds! 
As far as the beer, they are serving beers from other local brewers until their beer is ready. I'm told 4-6 weeks. They had beer from Revision, Imbib, Brasserie, and more. I'm looking forward to going back and trying their beer!

It was fully packed because of a thunderstorm and power cut earlier that day and thankfully we had a reservation but they were clearly not prepared for the rush. Our server was also a bartender and made it very clear that he did not have 2 minutes to take our order. My margarita was extremely sour and bitter. I know my cocktails and this was just downright bad. We ordered the free flatbread that we got with the yelp offer and shrimp lettuce wraps. Both were decent. For main course we decided to split a duck that I wanted to be done medium well. Well, the duck comes to our table and it's clearly all pink. The server says he heard medium rare instead of medium well and takes it back. The duck comes back in just 3 minutes with just the outside cooked. It was still pink inside. Our server throughout looked drunk and vanished somewhere during entree and someone else took over. That girl ended up putting the flatbread that came free with the yelp offer on the bill but I'll give it to her that she removed it when we showed her the offer. We ordered a corn bread to go and when we got home and opened the box, we clearly received a half eaten corn bread and we did not have any corn bread left overs from our dinner. This is the service you get when you end up paying $95 for a dinner for two. My suggestion would be to be prepared for the rush. Add more kitchen staff and servers.

Cons...loud, annoying, drunk people hovering over your table while you are trying to eat on the patio, hot combo appetizer platter was overcooked (mussels were the size of peas) and unflavorful (mussels, clams and shrimp were sitting in a bowl of hot water).

From the time I walked in I was greeted by a very lovely staff with a friendly atmosphere. The technician was very kind and thoughtful. He explained every step, played music to my request which helped tremedously and talked me through the exam. My nerves were at ease. A week later I had a MRI on my spine that I was dreading. I would usually request an open MRI but the tech advised the time in the machine I used previously is much shorter. I appreciate that he explained that. My second appt was with a different technician but equally helpful. He gave me headphones for music, eyewear that was soft and soothing so I didnt see the tunnel which helped me greatly and checked in with me during each segment of the test.

The restaurant itself is lovely - decorations are minimal, but beautiful. The seating was comfortable, the staff was wonderful, our waiter was very friendly & informative, and we were checked on by the chef & the manger of the restaurant (the family who owns/runs the restaurant) - both were so very gracious & warm & welcoming.

The food was stellar. We started with the Bombay Shrimp, the Pakoda, and the Crabmeat Pudha. Each dish was as delicious as the next. The shrimp and cauliflower were especially out of this world. 

For dinner we ordered the pork vindaloo, the goat masala, and the chicken briyani - all of us sharing bites from each other's plates. While each dish was delicious, the chicken briyani was outrageously good. It was served in a mini iron dutch oven, it was a huge serving (even with all three of us eating generous portions from it - I still had some leftover that I was able to take home (their to-go bags are fabulous, by the way!)), and the further down into the mini dutch oven you went, the more flavorful & delicious it was. We also tried the garlic naan and the truffle oil naan. Impossible to decide which was better. Both were so so SO good. We told our waiter to go ahead & select the roti sathi (or bread companions) for us - and he brought us royal paneer, gobi & daal - which were all terrific! 

We also shared two desserts - the jammin' jamun, and the flan me to the moon. The fig-date-praline ice cream is quite possibly the most delicious ice cream I've ever had. And while I'm not normally a fan of flan, this flan was firm & creamy.

The food isn't bad. The chips as a starter was actually really good. Tastes fresh, yet not oily at all. And when dipped into the green sauce on the table, it had the perfect amount of crunch and spice.

The rest of the food was just average. The menu was all over the place - I was looking for a Tinga burrito - not offered. However, there's Tinga fries! Wifey wanted a shrimp taco - not on the menu. But they did have shrimp fajitas! The waiter said the chef would be able to make it, but it's weird that it's not on the menu. So wife did the shrimp fajitas.

The fajitas came out quick, but came out incorrect. Wife requested her entree have the salad's sour cream on the side. They brought it out with sour cream on top, and an additional side of sour cream. No big deal, but later I was charged for the additional side. And they took her plate back to just take off the pieces of lettuce with sour cream. And yes, I said plate. Aren't fajitas usually served on skillets? Not here. Came out on a plate, already cooked. She noted her shrimp was grilled very well, but there wasn't too many pieces of shrimp. Lots of onions though.

My carnitas burrito came out ginormous, but it seemed short on carnitas too. And there's no sour cream on the burrito - I used my paid-for sour cream for that.  I only ate half as I was full from the chips. No sauce on top of your burrito either as some other places do with mole, tomatillo, or verde.  Not offered here.

Service was really friendly, and the place isn't too big (in a somewhat busy plaza), but I think the food leaves a lil more to be desired than I'd like.  And the prices aren't THAT great.

Over the past year and a half I have been consistently blown away by, not only the diversity of the music acts they bring to the stage, but the diversity of different venues and clubs they bring these acts to. 
What really pushed me to write my first Yelp review on VGP was the recent announcement  of the Benefit For Environmental Justice in Equador taking place at The M Room on October 23. When I first heard the name of Joe and Alex's production company of course I thought of The Kink's. But what I also thought about was the idea of being green and using their name in to contrast benefits like the upcoming one at The M Room.

When I hit Hi-Pointe Drive-In the other day, there was a line that probably would have extended out the door, except it was kinda cold out, so instead it snaked around the inside of the restaurant, clogging the aisles in the dining area.

If there had been a fire, I probably would have made it out alive, but let's just say it wouldn't have been pretty.

The night before, someone had smashed one of the glass doors with a brick, maybe to protest Der Fuhrer, or maybe just because they wanted a hamburger and they didn't want to wait until the following morning.

Outside, there was a guy either filming a segment for the local evening news or surveying the landscape for a forthcoming construction project. I don't know enough about the equipment they use to be able to tell.

I figured I might be in line for a while, as if this were Thunder River, and I was concerned, because waiting for food makes me emotional, but I was out of there with my to-go order in about 20 minutes.

When I saw the line moving so quickly, I figured this might be a matter of them having come up with some high tech way to put together hamburgers, but come to find out they're using a system not unlike the one at one of my first fast food jobs, at Hardee's.

It seemed as if all of the various parts of the burger, including the meat, had already been prepared, and when you ordered all they did was pile them on a bun, set it on a tray and hand it to you. The whole process couldn't have taken any more than like 90 seconds.

I don't know that my burger was significantly worse for not having been slaughtered and butchered out back in the parking lot of the movie theater while I waited, but it just didn't seem right to spend $10-plus (for a burger and fries), i.e. my weekly dinner budget, for something so easy to put together.

I had the Smash 'N Grab, the daily special named for the incident the night before. It consisted of a burger with caramelized onions, bacon and brick cheese, whatever that is. I was already gonna get a bacon cheeseburger, so this was--as Dewey Oxburger might put--perfect for me.

The caramelized onions were reminiscent of the rehydrated onions (rumored to be cabbage) at White Castle to an extent I wasn't prepared for. The brick cheese had congealed a bit by the time I got it home, and that may have actually made it better.

The meat was a bit more done than I require. (Ahem.) If I'd been thinking, I would have tried to get it mid-rare. Maybe they would have been forced to make it fresh.

The fries were natural-cut, which isn't necessarily my thing. Savage that I am, I prefer the thoroughly processed fries at fast food restaurants, but these were pretty good for what they were.

I'd definitely come back, but probably not until either the hype dies down some or they open another location.",2017-02-02 04:43:28,positif,neutre

To start, I have been here countless times--probably 20+--and have always enjoyed the food. I have had everything from their enchiladas de la casa, to their chicken mole, and even their combo platters and caldo de queso. I have yet to have anything on their menu that turned out to be a swing and a moss on their part, and their caldo de queso is among the best I've had. The overall vibe I get from the food is very home-like.

Now onto that dining room, which is probably one of the coolest ones I've ever seen in a Mexican restaurant. The beams, tile, and lighting make for a very nice place to be on evenings out.

Wait staff is always welcoming cordial, and they give you lots of time to look over the expansive menu. They are also very fast which is good as this place can really get packed at dinner time.

The only negative thing I can really say is that the prices, as others have mentioned, are a bit on the pricey side. Now, while the food is delicious, there isn't anything particularly fancy going on here with the ingredients, preparation, or presentation; it's honest, home-style Mexican fare, which I like. I feel they should probably charge accordingly. I see Italian places suffering from the same problem from time to time.

Well, that's a wrap and I am officially getting anxious for another trip back because I need some more of their caldo de queso in my life.",2021-12-31 20:15:41,positif,positif

Some of our favorite menu items are the chicken and shrimp fried rice, the hibachi dinners, the Fuji I, II, and III rolls, Hawaiian roll, Bree's roll, po boy roll, the list goes on! Literally ever single special roll that we have tried was on point! They are open to creating any custom roll that you request which is perfect when you have picky children. ;) 

When we want to keep it simple, we order the crunchy roll, California roll and the spicy tuna roll. Everything is always fresh. I have had tuna rolls at many sushi joints and let me tell you, Fuji has definitely been the freshest!  

Another favorite is the seaweed salad! Always fresh and good! 

Another great thing about Fuji is that they are genuinely kind and every time we call or go in they go above and beyond to ensure we have the best dining experience and leave happy. 

Overall Fuji Sushi is EXCELLENT! Definitely deserves 5 stars,  if not more.  It's a hidden gem for sure and I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for quality, fresh, affordable sushi.",2016-10-08 00:38:11,positif,positif

At the time,  we were looking for a solution to replace our 14-year-old tile shower, which started to have molds just around June 2017.   

Skip promised premium product (above industry standard quality) and premium service.    He promised that Installation would be done in 2 days and we would not have mold ever again.    he also promised a life-time warranty of their showers.    and a premium price.  

Our child was 7 months old.  so we wanted it done quickly and we accepted the premium price.   

However, the premium price was true.   Everything else is questionable.   They promised the work would be done in 2 days.   Well, it actually took 2 months to finish.   because first they did not even order the shower door when they came for installation.  Then they ordered the wrong size and wrong material.  we did not want to shop around too much so we bit the bullet.   However, during these 2 months time, we could not use this shower.  

there were quite a lot of unpleasant dealings even before the work was finished.  I would not share the aggravation with everyone here.   We went on with them in good faith.   

Anyway, upon installation, they left us a two page instruction about cleaning and maintenance.   basically, if we use a sponge, the warranty will be violated； if we use any spray, the warranty is violated; if we use certain brand of soap, the warranty is violated.    the only thing allowed is soft clothes with Dawn dish soap.    And after every shower, use squeezy, and hot water to clean off.       We were joking that we would become the indentured servants to the shower when we first read it.   

after the installation, with the very first usage, one corner leaked immediately.   Their technician came and fixed it.   within a month of usage, mold started.  their technician came and fixed it.   Another month came,  mold came back again.   We have been in this cycle until now.    every time there is a repair, we could not use this shower.    We got so tired of it that we reduced the usage of this shower by 50%.   

so what is going on?  after all the care and extra maintenance, why do we still have mold?    if a 'solution' put us back to ground zero, what is it then?    When we asked the company, we were told that our house had mold.    This statement cannot be true because we have 3 other showers including one in the basement that is also used daily and all of them are fine.    A third party investigation proves that our house does not have mold.    Now they asked us to sign an agreement that they would recaulk one more time, then we will have to pay for anymore repair in the future.      they also implied that we were unclean therefore our shower would have mold.      

However, we have 3 other older bathrooms and they are fine.  We also have a cleaning lady.     What about there might be some design/materials/quality issues with their products.  

this letter was the last straw.     

i want to apologize for the 4-star review i gave them before.    i am sorry if i mislead anybody into using them.    

Please do yourself a favor: do not use this company.   Shop around a little (Our youngest child was 7 months old then. we didnot.).  A shower should not rule your life.     you really do not want to see the shower guy and call their front desk on a monthly basis.",2018-10-27 04:10:59,négatif,négatif

Suffice to say, a lot of locals think of their name when they are pondering over where to pick up some beverages for themselves or an occasion, and it is nice having a local business do well and expand for so long, too.  This particular location on old North Virginia Street is located in the same complex as the Bonanza Casino.  Easy to find with plenty of parking, you can quickly stop in and grab what you need, or browse their shelves for something a bit more interesting.

The selection here covers all the bases you could want.  Beer ranging from the big mass-market brands to craft staples to local favorites.  Plenty of wine on the shelves, and certainly enough liquor to float a watercraft in, handily broken out by type, style, and brand.  And while this is certainly not the place to find some rare spirit or artisan liqueur, you will almost certainly find something to suit your tastes, or even discover something interesting worth trying out.  My favorite tip is to stop in here to snag a bunch of the tiny airline-sized bottles of booze, as they make great stocking stuffers around holiday time.

Prices are really decent, pretty much on par with other stores in town.  Though make sure to browse and see what might be on sale, as you can land some good deals.  Service has always been pretty friendly and helpful, too.

With the exception of the ESA and Love Stout (which is more of a personal thing than anything else, as I've never enjoyed ESB's or Stout to begin with) all of their selections have quickly become personal favorites of mine.

I've often visited the Brewery bar, which has a wide-open factory floor vibe to it. The pool table is free there, so my brother and I always grab some Brawler or IPA and go a few rounds until they close. I even tried their Chorizo Quesadilla one time (which may or may not still be available, because their food selection seems to vary) and was pleasantly surprised.

Yards is a great place to visit for a Growler, and you can fill it up for cheap if you recycle your old bottle. They also let you mix and match a case, which is a considerably better deal than getting six-packs of craft beer just about anywhere.

There was one day recently, I think a Saturday or Sunday, when it was inexplicably crowded and it seemed like the staff wanted nothing to do with us, as I had to bother them several times to get service. It must have just been an off day, though, since every other time the staff have been not only prompt but also happy to talk about their beer selection.

This past Sunday, the store I work for part time decided to have an employee party there and I finally got to check it out! I arrived an hour early by accident (LOL oops!) so I sat at the bar with Sean and browsed over the menu. The bartender (whose name I forgot, but he was really helpful) offered to make me a custom drink since I admittedly couldn't make up my mind. So many to choose from! I told him I liked rum and fruity drinks that don't taste too much like booze so he concocted me something that smelled of oranges and tasted AWESOME. I kept meaning to ask what he put in it but I forgot! Alas.

We were both starved so we decided to order one dish to try for each of us. He got the slider burger things with the bacon aioli and fried plantains and I got the Spaniard Scampi off of their special birthday menu. OMG. The shrimp was beyond amazing. It came in a garlicy shallot butter white wine sauce. Oh God. So. Freaking. Amazing. It also came with about 4-5 pieces of shrimp and 3 slices of bread for dipping. I liked that they offered to bring me more bread when I had consumed all of it and all of the shrimp and all that remained was dipping sauce. Mmm. I tried a bite of the slider things and they were tasty but nothing special and Sean agreed. I am not sure if I'd order those but I do prefer seafood, lol.

When our party arrived (20+ people) we mosied on over to the back of the restaurant. Man. I really dig on the decor here. It is SO up my alley. It's as if they came up with a Guillermo del Toro themed restaurant. SERIOUSLY. If you are a fan of his movies, EAT HERE. I demand it! :) Another note, the staff was VERY friendly and attentive. They did a FABULOUS job with our humongous party! They were running around frantically to make sure everyone got their orders in and food started coming out pretty quickly. I was impressed, needless to say! I got to try a couple of bites of some other tapas that my coworkers had ordered. I almost ordered the wicked good shrimp but glad I didn't because it was too damned spicy for my taste. LOL. I'm a pansy, I know. I did end up getting the chicken skewers and while  the grilled chicken flavor was incredible, I really didn't like the dipping sauce that they came with. It was sort of coconutty and had a faint curry aftertaste but the reason why I didn't like was because it was too spicy again! I think you can totally find good eats at Sanctuaria if you don't like spicy food, just make sure you ask your server or bartender for suggestions. You won't be disappointed! I wanted to ask for suggestions but they were trying so hard to get everyone's order in so I just went for the chicken randomly. Next time I will ask, hehe. The chef did come out to check up on us which I thought was a nice touch. I asked him for a non spicy dipping sauce and he gladly brought some bacon aioli dipping sauce--mmm!

As a little bonus, they brought us free cookie cake thingies since it was their anniversary/birthday. Cute touch! I will definitely be back to Sanctuaria. I am so glad it's close to where I live!!",2011-12-14 05:02:17,positif,positif

There is a nice little courtyard, with an impressive looking gas grill, pool, basketball court, seating/lounging area, and walkway. There is a tiny dog park here off to the side for those that bring their dogs.

Amenities also include a basic fitness room, open 24/7, and free wi-fi. There is a hot breakfast in the mornings which I enjoyed. Each day they had such items as scrambled eggs, 2 types of sausage, grits, oatmeal, waffles, and potato pancakes. For drinks there was soda, water, coffee, tea, and juice.

While the hallway to our room smelled musty and felt damp, our room was fine (We got the standard king size room). There are 2 TVs in the room, one in the living room and 1 in the bedroom. The kitchen is nice in that there is a full size fridge, dishwasher, microwave, stove, and all the kitchen utensils and drink ware you would need if you were going to cook a meal in your room. The room itself was spacious, and the bed was comfortable. The A/C unit worked fine, and the bathroom was very clean. Our room faced the courtyard, and while we could hear people playing games on the basketball court outside, we couldn't hear any neighboring rooms so sound retention seemed to be good.

This location is close to the wonderful Cochon and Cochon Butcher restaurant, so if you want some good eats, walk over a short distance and you'll be there!

So we get to the 3rd building again and her focus was not on us as she was assisting another guest. At one point my husband asked her about a shadow box that we could possibly use as a display. Her response was curt and rude and she wasn't really listening to what he wanted.  She automatically assumed that we wanted to purchase her displays which wasn't the case at all.

It is small but they give you plenty of space between tables so you don't feel overcrowded. There are also a few tables outside. This place is nice but I wouldn't call it the best Italian in Philly. I don't think you can even compare this place to Modo Mio or Mercato.

Mini crab cake appetizers were actually pretty large and delicious. This was the tastiest part of our meal. These may be the best crab cakes that I have had in Philly. If everything tasted this good, I would have rated this place a 5 instead of a 3.

I ordered the Vegetarian tasting and I guess they alter it by the day since what I got was a little different than the menu. I didn't mind but the waiter never mentioned it. The Farm Salad is a typical side salad- good but nothing exceptional. The Risotto Pattie was fried and didn't have much taste to it- by frying it, the taste of the risotto was lost. I would rather just have risotto. Menu shows roasted potatoes but my meal came with kale and artichokes which were decent. The small cup of mushroom soup that came with the tasting was outstanding. 

My fellow diner got the Penne Ragu. I tried it and thought it was very average and didn't have enough taste. 

The bread that they brought out at the beginning was also very average. They drizzled a very small amount of olive oil on it (hardly enough to add any flavor). I much rather the olive oil be given separate and not already on the bread.

Most grocery stores may be priced high for some items but then are bargains for other items. I have never seen any bargains here. I will only go here if I am desperate. With the Italian market in the neighborhood, I see no reason to go to this Acme as their produce, meats and cheeses are at least double the price as the Italian Market and not any fresher. $8 for pound of very average deli style turkey is expensive and $8 for a pound of American cheese is insane. I usually buy my deli meats and cheeses at Wegmans in Cherry Hill and pay about half the price for much better quality. Literally, everything in this store is a $1-$2 more or twice the price that you would find in other grocery stores. At these prices, you might as well go to Whole Foods.

The store is a bit dingy. The prepared food section, ethnic foods and organic foods lack a variety of options. There is plenty of parking, but the lot was a bit dark and could have had better lighting. 

I would only suggest going here if you need to quickly pick up a couple of basic items, and don't have the time to go anywhere else.

The employees here do move a bit slow. I couldn't believe how long it took for the deli person to slice some cheese and turkey and the line that developed while I waited.

You know that moment in the chair when you realize this person doesn't know what she is doing?  I should have stopped it right then!

My hair color looks horrid. Lines of demarcation, very uneven, funky ends, so not what I asked for.. ITS HORRID!! 

 She was dismissive of what I wanted, she was rushed, contradicting herself and didn't really seem to care that I left not knowing just how bad this looked. When I got home my husband was like, what happened? I payed for this horrid color! Now what am I going to do!

The salon looked run down, not very clean,  not as cozy or relaxing as I look for in a salon experience!

I'm so very disappointed!  I defiantly won't be going back!

Forgot to mention, my hair cut is totally uneven.. Not surprised, she didn't check it after she dried it.. Just wanted my money and to move on to the next. So frustrated!",2014-04-30 13:23:09,négatif,négatif

Their burritos try to be wraps with warms fillings.   Quesadillas try to more like pizzas with their flatbread and extensive toppings.

The margarita was pretty good and not overly expensive; and, like the staff, it wasn't too passive or too aggressive.  The guacamole had a nice kick of garlic and there was plenty to share.  I had the chicken enchilada with salsa verde.  The portion size was fine for me, but for a bigger eater it might be a little on the small side.  The chicken was really well-cooked - tender and flavorful - and the salsa verde was tasty, but had been mellowed a little too much.  It needed more tang and just a hint more spice.  My friend had the short rib torta, with which she was a bit disappointed.  It wasn't bad by any means, but she said it was just a little too ordinary, more regular old sandwich than torta.

So, I'm giving it four stars based on my meal, the service and the atmosphere ... and perhaps mostly because I would like to go back soon to try more of the menu.  (And, another drink. Shh.)",2010-05-11 00:21:24,positif,neutre

Same waitress both times, who was very knowledgeable about wines and the food, and attentive as well. They were even able to accommodate our reservation for a friend who decided to come with us at the last minute, even though the restaurant was pretty full at 8pm on a Friday evening!

Food is pretty good, focused on French-ish cuisine using local ingredients. We were there about 4 weeks apart and the menu had changed somewhat already - not sure if this is a regular occurrence or if it was just the season changing over. In any case, it made me happy to have new options to try. The menu is a good size - enough choices but not overwhelming.

The appetizers have been hit and miss - crispy duck fritters where I thought the frying overwhelmed the duck taste (but my husband loved), frogs legs with spaetzle and a tomato-based sauce just seemed like an odd combination (though the legs were cooked perfectly otherwise), but the cheese plate we had more recently was a nice assortment (but I found on the small side for the price). 

All the mains we've had have been excellent though - duck confit perfectly crispy, a thick juicy pork chop (both served with seasonal vegetables), and a tender (but not stringy) braised lamb shank with delicious smashed potatoes.

I would say that it's on the expensive side but not as expensive as Normand's. A nice treat - make sure you make reservations!",2013-11-05 21:39:15,positif,positif

Last night while driving around, my girlfriend and I passed this restaurant, which has a phenomenal display from the outside. The inside was really beautiful, great set up I must say. I have dined at a lot of four and five star dining, and this place decor is amongst the best. We were served that wonderful chip and salsa that everyone posted about. That was about the best meal of our night. We both ordered the chimigunga entree which was one of the worst Mexican meals I ever had. The worst I have ever experienced. The dish authenticity is gone. It was easy to identify that they have grown to the point, where authenticity has been compromised by utilizing box products over natural species and products to cook the food. Price for the quality of food doesn't match. Over priced for what they are serving. 

Overall, the drinks were good and the chip and salsa. Beyond that, this experienced will never have is return to this place. Quality should never be sacrificed for money.

Great massage, not so great pedicure. I wish I could remember the masseuse's name but I can't. It was amazing. The pedicurist spent more time on her phone than my pedicure and the end result really wasn't what an almost $100 (with tax and tip) pedicure should be. Not happy. 
Now to today... I purchased a Groupon for a massage and made an appointment. While on the phone, the woman scheduling the appointment told me to click ""redeemed"" to get a number on my Groupon. I did and the coupon disappeared. I tried to get back to it and couldn't find a number, it just showed used. I explained this as it was happening and this woman dismissively tells me to just call her back when ""I figured it out."" Nice. 
So within a minute or so, I ""figured it out,"" called back, and not even so much as an explanation as to why she told me to mark it used, she coolly said I was booked. (The reservation was more than 24 hours out, what if I had to cancel it?)
So basically, a not very professional, dismissive receptionist, and past experience with the absent pedicurist may make this my last visit after I use this groupon, depending upon how the rest of the appointment goes. I prefer places I spend my money to actually provide me adequate customer service.
After the massage...
Nice massage after the knot-kneading was over which I particularly said I did not like. I'll be sore for a couple days.

She was attentive, had a wonderful smile and was very patient in not only helping us select the perfect items for a special evening, but was sweet in not making us feel rushed.  

My husband and I had some friends in town from Austin whom we rarely see, we wanted to give them an unforgettable dining experience in St. Pete.  We enjoyed several of the appetizers, such as the fried cauliflower, tuna crudo, and Florida burrata.  They were all as delicious as they were beautifully presented.  The tuna crudo was my favorite, it was incredibly fresh and light, and the basil oil was exquisite.  We made quick work of our appetizers while we enjoyed a few beverages from the happy hour menu.  

For dinner, the table decided to split the whole fish, crushed fingerling potatoes, blistered snap peas, and squid ink tagliatelle.  The whole fish was a huge red American snapper, and it was the most fabulous fish I've ever eaten!  It is locally sourced, and comes topped with a wonderfully complimentary fennel salad as well as a side of salsa verde with capers, which is absolutely to die for.  The crushed fingerling potatoes are a must try- they are crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and just a delicious burst of flavor that I've never experienced in a potato before.  The snap peas had a wonderful texture and flavor as well; 
 the diavolo sauce and crunch were a perfect addition to the meal.  Finally, the squid ink tagliatelle was every bit we'd dreamt of and more.  It was full of prince edward island mussels and baby octopus, and the house made squid ink pasta was delicious.  The sauce wasn't too heavy or too light, and was a perfect compliment to the flavorful dish. 

Our friends were delighted to find the wine list was so extensive and diverse.  They spotted a wine from their trip to South Africa, a 2014 red wine blend called ""Missing Virgin"" by Post House.  This was a fabulous, medium bodied wine with soft tannins, that is so fruity, light and dry- perfect compliment to our meal and such a wonderful find to cap off the evening.  We will definitely be back for this one on a wine Wednesday.

But it's not just the food that was impressive, the craft cocktails were a total treat. (Don't judge the day drinking!) I look forward to returning on my next visit to Nashville.

Manager Mike (who ""does everything,"" according to his staff) was abrupt & rough around the edges immediately upon my entering the salon, but he later walked over to converse, which was welcomed. He was very pleasant. 

The two friendly, dedicated, & professional women mentioned above spent from 1 PM until 4:40 PM on my fingers & toes. (I am happy I avoided the busy weekend.) I've never had a salon worker take more time w/ my toes; Marie gave each nail so much attention. And Eva was a pro w/ my Ombre nails; she made the process look easy. Beautiful work!

This is a clean salon located beside Dillard's; the entrance is on Paseo Dr. The salon has been here 5 years. The hours are CONVENIENT: seven days a week from 10 AM till 7:30 PM Monday thru Saturday, & Sundays from 11 AM till 6 PM. 

There are 4 wall TV's-- all were set on the HGTV channel. The massage chairs are comfortable. A blue plastic liner sits in every basin. I really enjoyed the surround sound relaxing instrumental music. Each nail station was fronted w/ plexiglass, & each offered a knee-level built-in fan to dry newly polished fingernails. 

Avalon offers many services. (See the pic of the 2 sided pricing sheet.) Services include Nail Enhancements (Ombre; Gel; Pink & White; etc.) Dips; & Pedicures & Manicures (including children's). There are multiple Spa Treatments such as Lavender; Green Tea; Peppermint Spice; Orange; Honey; Aloe; Chamomile; & Organic. (Mike requested that I not post the menu pics I took of the spa treatments.) Foot Massages & Waxing services are available. Facials, Eyelash Extensions, & many other services are listed. 

Staffers wear masks. Guests may choose to wear masks (or not). Hand sanitizer is available. Soft drinks, water, & wine are offered to each patron. This salon will even arrange a party here for your special occasion. Groups of 7+ receive 10% off. Gift certificates are available for purchase.

I did not award 5 stars for one reason-- ""Add-On"" prices. Prices here are higher than the four other salons I've visited -- perhaps to cover for the mall overhead. 

The Ombre nails were $67, which was a little high. But my pedicure was MUCH too expensive. This salon has more Add-On services than any salon I've ever visited. For instance, I was charged $29 for a Classic Pedi then an additional $16 for gel. $5 was added for French nails on top of a $15 charge for the floral nail design-- a total of two flowers, no rhinestones. This $65 pedicure is what normally costs me much less elsewhere. Additionally, my floral design was rudimentary-- far less detailed than what I've received at two other salons. $15 was simply too much money for the design & design quality. (See pic.)

Will I return? Most likely. Both women did PHENOMENAL work w/ my manicure & pedicure. Will I get gel French nails? No, due to the cost. Will I get a another design? I'm unsure. But if I do, I'll request pricing prior to any work being completed & I'll ask to see pics of previous designs completed by the nail tech.",2021-06-23 03:16:20,positif,positif

Well: wow. I gotta say that my customer service expectations are pretty high and Firebirds hit them. For the most part, the staff was attentive. Don't remember having to ask the server to do anything, he was always asking if we needed anything. They lost a star because we found hair in my child's meal, but the manager promptly took care of it and took the dish off our bill. 

The food was delicious and filling. I liked the choices they had for the children. Nice portions. I have a 10 yr son who eats like a grown man and he was satisfied. So kudos.

So as I reflect on my first visit, I have to update and after my second visit. Firebird....firebird....firebird! I'm sorry buuuut we probably won't be back. I'm so sad to say that. My first visit was great (my husband would say otherwise) but he was willing to give it another go. This visit really fell short in the service department. Excellent customer service is really hard to find and I'm sad to say, Firebird didn't fulfill that excellent service we had experienced the first time. There realllly, really needs to be a overhaul of how they train their staff. It was fairly slow, so I figured the fa would come out a little faster than what they did.

We arrived at 6:15---having a 6:15 reservation made through opentable.com.   We were made to wait for about 10 minutes before being seated.

After we were seated our waitress arrived and asked us if we wanted a drink.  Since the drink menu is extensive, we asked her to come back in a few minutes.  10 minutes later she returned.  There were four in our party.  Two order draft beers; one a margarita and the other a glass of wine.   A few minutes later the waitress returned to tell us that they were ""out"" of one of the draft beers ordered.  Strike one.  

We then placed our orders.  When I ordered a Caesar salad, I was told that the were ""out"" of Caesar salads.  Seriously----how can you be ""out of Caesar salad.   I ordered the smoked short rib fritters in place of my Caesar salad.    My dining companions all ordered a wedge salad.   Strike two.

When the wedge salads arrived, I was informed that they were ""out"" of the short rib fritters.  Strike three.   I was asked if I wanted to order something else, and I declined.

Within 2 minutes of the wedge salads arriving the entrees and sides we ordered arrived.  My dining companions had just started their salads, yet now platters of food were being delivered.  When I commented on the fact that the food should be staged to come out after salads are done, our waitress told us that they ""weren't busy"" so the food came out quickly.  Seriously??? What kind of excuse is that. 

I ordered the 1/2 chicken and it was decent....My dining companions ordered baby back ribs. As a side, I ordered Cole slaw, which was inedible----it was very sour; not your typical Cole slaw.  One of my dining companions said that his French fries were cold and tasteless.  

When it was time to end this nightmare of a dining experience, we asked for rib bags for leftovers.  It took 10 minutes for our waitress to return.  We asked for hand wipes----this is a rib place---and she said ""oh----you want hand wipes??""   She had another server deliver four pathetically small hand wipes.   And then---to top it off---she forgot to bring our checks.  Finally, checks arrived and the bill was paid.   I dine out often and never regret spending money on well prepared, well served meals in establishments that at least pretend to value their customers.    This is something we did not experience and felt like we had been cheated out of what should have been a good dining experience by a restaurant that is clearly mismanaged.

Fire Jackie and maybe I'll consider your business again. 

I brought my dogs in for their usual haircuts, and Jackie made me feel like I was a negligent pet owner. She had to bring it to my attention how dirty my dogs were! They needed five baths, she claimed, of course they're needed baths! It's all in the name Scruffy 2 Fluffy! What am I supposed to do? Wash them myself and then pay for their services? Then she went on to say what a danger fox tail stickers are by conveniently pulling out a Post-it note with one on it. My dogs are never in an environment of where there would be fox stickers from grass. It didn't end there. She claims my two dogs both have double ear infections and they're so matted. I would think if they had double ear infections there would be some sign of uncomfortable pain, but nope! And of course the dogs are going to be a little matted. That's why I go here. If I was a dog groomer I wouldn't need this place.
For my other dog I was shown a picture of how much fur they removed and told there was five more piles where that came from; I know, that's what I paid $75 for. Then when he got home he threw up a large amount of yellow vomit that looked like he was given something he shouldn't have been given.
My little dog looked very nervous and upset when he was picked up. He never looked so scared before. In prior grooming places he never looked tormented like he did here. 
After getting an ear full of Jackie telling me how to care for my dogs she tells me I need to bring them in more often. With her attitude? I don't think so. I'll take my dogs and my money elsewhere.",2018-05-28 18:18:02,négatif,négatif

I went in for a scone (which were clearly house made & fresh off the press)  Blueberry was the flavor of the day and I looooooooove blueberry.  So it was pretty much a wrap; I'll take an iced black coffee and blueberry scone please & thank you.  The place was nice and quaint.  Not easy to spot from the street so pull on the side road and there's a parking lot where you'll see Living Room off to the right.  It's a shotgun style cafe; plenty of lighting and seating along the window.  The patio was spacious with a few picnic benches.

I actually walked through the meat shop on Sutton through the back door and right over to Living Room; it sits in the rear of the meat shop.  They probably didn't like that but oh well.

Then all of a sudden I asked about the huge cookie sitting in the beautiful glass jar on top of the counter and everyone raved how it was the most delicious item in the place. It was a peanut butter chocolate chip cookie except it didn't have any flour so it was basically baked peanut butter.   I conceded... 

Got the baked peanut butter and superb iced cold brew and bounced.

I didn't eat the cookie right away but when I did break a small piece for the purposes of finalizing this review I wasn't blown away.  It was just OK.  Maybe it was the heavy Fleur de Sel they dusted the cookie in.  I'm not a salt girl so I found myself scrapping and patting sea salt residue so I could tolerate the taste and finish like a champ.

We used the no wait app to get in line on the way, which I highly recommend! Our table was ready when we arrived. Our service was phenomenal again. We did have to wait a bit for service and the food, which we didn't mind, but they offered us an order of the risotto balls and dessert on the house. We were so appreciative! The risotto balls were fantastic - super cheesy, crispy and paired with hot marinara and a delicious creamy, lemony herb aioli. Perfect for sharing! I got the bucatini again which was just as delicious as the first time. My boyfriend tried the garganelli pasta with braised beef and olives. This was a hit! It's a super hearty, warm and briney dish with the olives. My friend tried the lasagna verde. This dish is complex, hearty and perfectly executed. I hate dry lasagnas, but this one had lots of bolognese and bechamel sauce. Highly recommend this dish! I do think they should serve it on a larger plate though. For dessert, we had the coffee cookies and cream gelato and ""not tiramisu"" coffee tart. Both were excellent! Thanks to Pastaria for another 5 star experience! I can't wait to come back and try a pizza soon. 

I'm not joking when I say I stalked Pastaria's Facebook page for months waiting for them to open. I finally got to try it out last week, and it completely exceeded my expectations! So far, this has been my favorite meal since moving to Nashville! 

First of all, the service is truly exceptional. Our waiter was friendly, appropriately attentive, and knowledgeable. I was so impressed. It really makes this place stand out! Also, I went with a friend, but I was pleased to see many families here. It's a perfect spot for date night OR families, which is rare to find. It was not overly noisy at all. They do have a children's menu also.

Before your meal, the staff walks around serving delish pieces of freshly baked bread that is perfectly complimented by the olive oil, chile oil and cheese on the table. Love that chile oil! To begin, we split the fabulous chopped salad with olives, pistachios, pecorino, pepperonis and red wine vinaigrette. I LOVED this salad, and the small portion split between two was a perfect light appetizer. 

It was nearly impossible to pick an entree! Pastaria makes all of their pastas and pizza dough fresh daily. Everyone around me had big, beautiful bowls of pasta, so I went with the Bucatini All' Amatriciana while my friend tried the Strozzapreti. The Strozzapreti is a more traditional Bolognese style pasta and was fabulous.  I was SO impressed with the Bucatini!! The sauce was rich, fresh, a little spicy and had a delicious smokiness from the guanciale. I would absolutely order this again!

Normally, we split one dessert when trying new places, but the menu looked and sounded so great here, so we had to try two - the butterscotch pudding with oatmeal cookies and the coffee tart. They also have a nutella fudge cake option and variety of house made gelato whose flavors they change our regularly. The butterscotch pudding was thick, creamy and packed with flavor. It was topped with a Greek yogurt whipped cream (they didn't say Greek yogurt but that's how it tasted), and two freshly baked spice oatmeal cookies. Loved this dessert, but loved my coffee tart even more! The coffee tart was not overwhelmingly strong, but it was creamy, rich and topped with delicious crunchy toppings (no idea what they actually were! Sort of like a homemade cereal) and a big scoop of homemade whipped cream, which is one of my favorite things! Don't skip dessert here!

I was truly blown away with Pastaria, especially since they just opened. We had exception service, and every part of the meal was exceptional and fresh. I've been telling all of my friends and coworkers about Pastaria. It's my new favorite date night and special occasion restaurant. I can't wait to go back!

Mostly because the pharmacist was awesome.  She totally remembered my name and prescriptions after the second time I stopped by.  And whenever there were issues of any sort, she worked through with me, patiently and with a great attitude.  

Other than that, well this CVS is possibly a little more treacherous than the rest due to its location on Canal.  I believe a security guard and perpetrator died here a few months ago, but ever since then, a very visible security/police presence has been felt on site.  

Also due to its close proximity to Canal and the French Quarter - tons of wine, beer, and even a pretty impressive array of liquor behind the cashiers.  Reasonably-priced, no mark-up - which they could totally get away with, but i guess CVS being a big ole corporation with a reputation to protect, they don't.  

The cashiers can be a little incompetent and sometimes they permit a rather long,winding line to form.  Still, I much prefer this CVS to the three Walgreens in close proximity - it just feels more orderly and a nicer selection of convenience items.",2010-08-31 21:39:38,positif,positif

I was concerned since it was a difficult surgery including two titanium rods being placed to hold my femur (long bone) in place for healing, they will remain permanently. 

I will be setting off the X-ray machines off at the airports ;) 

It's amazing how youthful Dr. Walker looks for someone with such accomplishments. He did his residency at the Minnesota Mayo Clinic! That's impressive. He was very kind and caring, addressing all my questions and concerns. I was a little surprised when I saw my X-ray the first time...I was surprised at the sheer size of those titanium rods. It's pretty shocking how large they are; one is from hip to knee and the other is from hip to other rod at top.

I had my first post-on appointment at ROC and I was pretty impressed with the facility even though it's 50 years old. There is a whole area for physical therapy and rehabilitation. This place is a well oiled machine and I hardly had to wait at all for my appointment. 

Dr. Walker is a excellent physician and did a Epic surgery on me, after only 4 weeks I am walking well, and barely need to use my cane. Wow after reading others reviews I feel blessed that I ended up with D. Walker as my surgeon.

My wife and I went to this Wendy's last week. I ordered the chili. When I order chili I expect it to have at least a tangible amount of meat in that thing. I don't care if it's cat meat, emu, human, just focking put some meat in that thing. Instead, I get this cup of goo that's so full of beans and no meat that it reminds me of my days in elementary chugging Elmer's glue by the liters. And I mean this chili was gross; It looked like cow cum mixed with chili seasoning and brought to room temperature. Just for me. I could take a shite that looked more like a chili. The aliens would agree cuz they probed me last week, so they'd know for sure, but I'm tellin' ya: Where's the meats. Apparently this product needs a label on the side of the chili cup that says ""Must provide your own meat. Meat not included"". C'mon, Wendy, are you too lit up on bong water to give us at least some possum in that chili of yours? Are you too drunk stumbling around fighting gravity, twerking to Lady Gaga, to at least throw some meat flavor into this chili. Excuse me, I mean ""chili"". This stuff's more suitable for brick mortar. I think if I eat this, my butt cheeks are gonna get glued shut as I'm trying to take a chris later after eating it. Wendy, even the United Nations would call this chili crimes against humanity.

I have waited many months for Centro to open and to have his food once again. So on opening night a table of 16 show up at prime time to try this new spot out. Centro is small plate style food. Plates that are intended for sharing and enjoying with a drink and friends. The plates range from $2 - 8 include Brussels sprouts, tacos, pumpkin bisque , roasted beets and many other delicious dishes. Large plates $12-16 included bone marrow and ribeye.  The popcorn was addictive with flavors that had tang, salt and sweet. We couldn't put our finger on it but you just kept eating it. I enjoyed the marrow with garlic chips that had a hint of sweet yet a nice crunch. The ribeye was tender and well seasoned. And of course I love brussel sprouts so it was hard to share them. Also with kitchen right there and food brought to the table when it's ready- everything was piping hot. You could see the steam whisper off the ribeye. 

Ryan our waiter was really put to the test. 8 separate checks, drink orders, and food orders that must have been about 23 plates. Since the plates are meant to be shared they don't all come out at once, and he had a lot of running to do.  He really tried to balance the separate checks and the new pos system, thank you, it had to be hard. 

The interior was beautiful. Bare red brick wall and hard wood floors. Full open kitchen, and you know I always suggest sitting where you can enjoy watching the chef cook. Our group was too big so next time I have my bar spot picked out to watch Stern in action. 

My mistake for not looking at the beer, wine and drink menu better, but we had just came from happy hour.

As my one friend reviewed all five dishes -- she summed it up perfectly.  Tastes like ""food.""  Personally she was stretching it a little.  Food was terrible.  Hot food was cold.  Chicken was dry.  Burgers were bland.

And then there was the service and lack of pudding.  Each meal was supposed to come with chocolate pudding, ice cream or some other dessert (don't remember).  As we ate our food -- served by our bad attitude server -- we joked about the chocolate pudding we were going to get.  When were were done, our server gave pudding to a table nearby, immediately came to our table and just handed us our checks....no chocolate pudding or any dessert offered to us.

Located on the far northwest quadrant of Indy, this park offers up all kinds of activities and venues for the whole family. Billed as one of the largest municipal parks in the United States, Eagle Creek has something that many parks do not: a massive body of water on which one can sail, fish, swim or watch a rowing event

In recent years, the park has added new features and buildings including the Earth Discovery Center and the Peace Learning Center a Bark Park and more..

The land on which the park sits belonged to the Lilly family and was donated to Purdue University in the 1950s, who later sold it to the city. The city built an earthen dam in the park to control flooding and this maneuver led to the Eagle Creek Reservoir that makes up a large portion of the recreation site. 

All in all, this is a great place to take the family for a picnic, ride a bike, canoe or just about any outdoor activity. Be forewarned, though....in the summer, the park can be packed and you might find it too crowded to enjoy. This is why I have personally scouted some other parks. We tend to head to Eagle Creek during odd days and times to avoid the crush. But, one of the best times to visit is in the winter months when you can just drive around and see lots of deer and other wildlife because the trees are bare - just don't feed anybody!!",2008-10-16 15:57:07,positif,positif

I immediately liked the ambiance upon stepping into the bar via a secret back hallway that adjoins the restaurant 47 Scott next door, which was super convenient because it was rainy outside! When we arrived for a bday dinner next door and were told there was a wait, someone came up with a genius idea to sneak next door for a drink while we were waiting for the table. There was plenty of seating when we arrived around 8 pm and we chose a cozy little booth on the side. 

SERVICE-  5 STARS
The bartender was super knowledgable about his craft and made some helpful recommendations. My drink tasted exactly as he described! Perfection! He also had separate checks ready for us very quickly.

DRINKS - 4 STARS
The drink names are so fun! My drink I think, was called the Northern Negotiator, which had apple Jack and a hint of balsamic reduction. It was slightly salty, sweet and strong, and kind of weird, just how he had described! I liked it. My girlfriends also ordered drinks with some fun names..I think taste-wise I really liked the Bidi Bidi Bom Bom, I might order that one next time. They're all so fun and different & I'm sure there's something for everyone. 
The only bad thing is that the drinks are kind of pricy --- BUT they are strong. These are definitely hand-made specialty drinks, not your club drinks that are just thrown together with splurts of vidka and soda flying everywhere. If you want to get your drink on hard core, you might go broke; but for a pre-dinner drink a few people or a late night rendezvous, it's perfect :)

Last week I had a rare weekday off, finally getting a chance to check out Transcend Mercer, which opened its doors last Monday.

Transcend is not new to the Edmonton scene, the Transcend Mercer being their third to join its Argyl and Garneau locations, but a fourth venture, after the closing of their Jasper Ave location last year. I had just discovered the Jasper location as a prime spot for relaxing and blogging when they announced their closure, unable to sustain their coffee-centric philosophy in a large downtown space. The Mercer location is now only four blocks away from the downtown core of Jasper Avenue, much smaller, although definitely a coffee-focused shop. I was excited to see if I could set up shop there! Future photo-editing and blogging space? Sorry Credo, you're closer but my God why are you always so busy, sad face.

Parking is almost near impossible in downtown and even more with the construction of the Rogers arena just north of the site. A lot of the clientele, I assume, are from businesses around the area or people who live in the downtown core and, of course, MacEwan University students looking for their caffeine-fix. The newly opened space is in the basement of Mercer Warehouse, down the stairs, on your left. It's quite a spacious set up despite it being smaller than their Jasper Avenue location. A large wood communal table draws most of your focus, great for large groups and study area and eight smaller tables surround the perimeter for those who want a more intimate conversation or a quiet space to work. The chairs are soft leather mixed with an industrial metal frame, which I found to be stylish and comfortable. But the best seats in the house? Bar stools at the extended counter, closest to the prep counter. Best way to know your coffee barista for sure.

That day I ordered a chai latte. Something about freshly brewed coffee makes my heart palpitate despite years of coffee consumption in my University days. I must be getting old. I don't actually recall ever trying anything but their coffees at past locations because clearly I would have remembered this chai latte! Predominantly cinnamon spiced (vs. cardamom spiced), I appreciated the coffee art in my to-stay cup. WiFi is locked, but is available for free with purchase.

So boy was I surprised when I moved and was told I had to submit proof that I moved. Then 30 days later they would cancel my membership and, oh by the way, slap me with a $100+ fee.  How can I submit proof I've moved before I move? This forced me to pay for a month of the gym when I didnt even live in Philly.

I don't understand how a ""local"" business like Sweat can just outsource one of the most important aspects of their business to a faceless company who refuses to work with you and has no knowledge of any conversation you had with the Sweat rep. Terrible.",2012-10-17 01:35:26,négatif,négatif

Monday's are one of the busiest mornings because tourists hit it up on their way to the airport. 
Still, the line moves fast and you get a menu while you're waiting so you're all set to order when you get in. 

Here's what we ate;

Bonuts - a little dry but good toppings. I'd skip it and get the Lily instead. 

East Nasty - the chicken was very flavorful but we thought it had an egg and it just didn't seem very breakfasty. Also we didn't love the biscuit

I was referred to Dr. Bleiler from my dentist to get my wisdom teeth out.  I made my appointment on a Friday afternoon, hoping that most people would be working.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.  It was crowded even though I came in 20 mins early.  I waited...and waited..and waited.  Two whole hours after my scheduled appointment time.  After my procedure, I was moved to a different room while I was waking from the IV sedation.  

The aftermath was horrible.  So much pain and the pain killers were not working (but I guess that's not really the doctor's fault).  A week passed without improvement on the pain so I called the office.  The receptionist was really nonchalant about my telling her about my pain.  Eventually they told me to come in for a check-up (I was more afraid of infection than the pain).  Again I came in and there was a crowded waiting room.  They put in some medicated packing to help the shooting pain.  Boy, avoid this packing at all cost.  The most pain you can imagine as they shove some gauze-like material into your fresh gum wounds.

A few days later, I had to come back in for them to remove the packing.  Again, a lot of people were waiting (some for three hours).  Fortunately, I was quickly called back since I was just a follow-up.  The packing was taken out by the nurse but she told me that the doctor wanted to check things out as well.  So I waited...and waited...a whole hour for Dr. Bleiler to take a ten second peek into my mouth.  So disappointing..but good thing I wont have to come back again!",2011-08-11 20:13:02,négatif,négatif

It was love at first sight. I thought this one of those places where if you have to ask how much it is to stay here, you can't afford it. It was only for the rich and famous.

Fast forward a few years and friends suggested we get a more ""Nola"" hotel than one of the big box places and booked us here. I was so excited to pull up and see it was my dream hotel, and we could afford it!!! Felt a little like a Roaring 20's starlet when the doorman in his top hat welcomed us. Room was everything I could hope for, beautifully decorated, and the bar. OMG...the bar. It's from the Grand Hotel in Paris and worth stopping in just to gaze at. And ask if Pamela is there....she will make you the best hurricane you ever had. Nothing like what you get in the quarter.

You'll recognize the rooftop pool because it's featured in so many movies. My favorite time in the pool is after dinner. You can star gaze and feel like you're in you very own pool cause no one else has caught on this is the bomb. And you work off you dinner...win win right!

We've stayed here many times, and never had a problem of any kind. The only reason we moved on was because we got free room at Harrahs and discovered how entertaining the river traffic was. That, and it does take a little longer and a little more wear and tear on our feet to get to our favorite haunts. But I highly recommend this hotel, and we still always drop by at least for a drink. The food in their Crystal Room is fab as well...we had the best Easter brunch of our life there.

I laugh at all the cheering for the Peanut Butter and Jelly at 10 p.m. First of all, who's in by 10 p.m.? Usually not us. And we're usually full and/or drunk but the one time I made a point of it and went down the table was swarmed. Free food...it was K Mart blue light special moment.

I really like the idea that much of the food is prepared by the students in the culinary program at Ivy Tech.

The space is very large and includes a good sized second-floor ballroom, along with smaller conference rooms which can be used for breakout sessions.  There is also a fairly large space on the first floor, which can be used as a ballroom, as well.

All of their spices are very fresh-- fresher than you can find anywhere else-- packaged in glass bottles (keeps them fresher, and is not toxic), and sold at prices comparable to what you'd find at a big box grocer (except for stuff like parsley, cilantro, garlic powder, black pepper balls, etc., which tend to run considerably higher). When you run out of a particular spice, you can buy it in a bulk package and just refill your jar. I've found that it's better to buy everything in the small jars (even though not as cost-effective at the outset) because, once you start shopping there and using their products, you really do become an addict. . . and will fast run out of space in your spice drawer/spice cabinet if you buy the large jars. They have every spice, herb, etc. imaginable, and they also have a ton of different mixes (for those who don't want to buy a bunch of different things and experiment on their own). Personally, I love using the ""Sandwich Sprinkle"" on tomatoes and salads (have yet to try it on a sandwich, since I don't make sandwiches at home), Arizona Dreaming in salsa and guacamole, Ruth Ann's Muskego Ave. Chicken and Fish Seasoning on tofu (though I'm sure it would also be fantastic on, well, chicken and fish), and the Mural of Flavor on pretty much everything. They also have a ""33rd and Galena"" spice that pays homage to their original location. They also sell dried lemon flakes, and orange flakes, which are great for people like me who don't keep fresh lemon or oranges around to grate, but need it for a recipe from time-to-time. They have more kinds of vanilla extract than you'd know what to do with, cake spice, anise, pumpkin spice, various kinds of cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. (they have a whole section devoted just to baking. . . and it's really cute!!!). You really can't go wrong stopping in here and browsing. Also, it helps that the employees are always really welcoming and really helpful (I suspect that many of them are more just working here to get out of the house and get some spending money than they are by necessity, so they're actually happy to be there)",2012-11-12 17:49:26,positif,positif

update**

Three of us went, my wife had the corn and crab stuffed shrimp. Three small shrimp butterflied with a small amount of stuffing on top. They where not the sized shrimp one should use for stuffing. The large portion of mashed potatoes were under seasoned. The carrots and squash were good.

We had Lobster bisque which was good and presented well. We also had the artichoke dip which did not present well. but was tasty.

I had the ribs, which were tough as leather, I did not eat but one. I tasted the enormously over sized portion of mashed potatoes. They too were under seasoned and not eaten. The succotash was ok. 

The server and manager where both nice and took care of the issue properly, removing the uneaten plate of food and asking if I wanted a different meal, I did not.

The restaurant lights was to dark for my taste. I had to use the light of a phone to read the menu. We've been disappointed each of the last several times coming here.",2018-12-24 13:21:10,négatif,neutre

Tables are first come first served so don't try to save seats- there were some folks doing this and they got corrected quickly.  The boat goes about an hour upriver to the battlefield of the war of 1812 with Charles giving much history on the way. We docked and were able to go looking around the site and the tiny museum plus the large monument dedicated to the site. You can listen to a ranger explain things but we could t hear him well so struck out on our own. It was fascinating history but I don't think I would take his trip a second time. On the way back downriver food was served buffet style and I have to admit it truly exceeded my expectations. There was red beans and rice which was smoky and flavorful, a gumbo with a deep rich roux, jumbalaya that was more tomatoey than I was used to, and a DELICIOUS seafood pasta with a rich cream sauce. Excellent. They also had salad and cornbread muffins which I didn't try. The bread pudding with a white chocolate rum sauce was excellent. 
   The ride back was a great history of the Katrina disaster from someone who lived it. Charles pointed out many examples of FEMA's shame.

I had the stops written down in my cell phone.  I listened carefully for the stops to be announced. Had no problem until the last leg of the trip on the Rt 7 bus.  My stop was announced, I immediately dinged the call bell.  The driver continued on past my stop.  I called to her that she had missed my stop.  She told me I hadn't rung.  I reiterated that I HAD.  She told me I should have paid attention, WHICH I HAD BEEN, VERY CAREFULLY, since it was full dark outside and I couldn't see a thing and don't live on that street anyway so wouldn't know any landmarks.  I was VERY careful to listen for my stop.  

Finally after arguing with me back and forth, she stopped and let me out. I had no idea how many stops she had skipped.  I asked how far back the stop I wanted (Echo @ Mt. Babcock) was and she told me she didn't know.  I am disabled, I walk very poorly with a cane, the EXPECTED walk back would have been bad enough, but she dumped me somewhere I did not know where in the dark and freezing windy cold.  I had to call my son to find out how far I had to walk back.  My cell phone often does not work, thank god it worked this time.  She kept telling me it was my fault for not paying attention, only I HAD been paying attention and I dinged the dinger as soon as my stop was announced.

SHE wasn't paying attention and then she was mean about it and dismissive and wouldn't even tell me how far I needed to walk back to get to where I was SUPPOSED to have been let off.  I would like to add she was also rude to an older man for just closing his eyes for a minute, something I had done SEVERAL times during the trip myself, and she rudely told him her ""rule"" was that there was no sleeping on the bus.  He wasn't sleeping and she didn't even address him, she kept yelling at some other guy who wasn't even sitting near him to ""wake his friend up"".  None of us on the bus at that point knew who or what she was talking about, and in point of fact I had been glancing back that way and had seen the guy close his eyes for just a few seconds before she started yelling at people in general apparently.  Finally the guy she was mad about having closed his eyes realized HE was the topic of conversation and popped his eyes open in surprise and said ""I'm not even asleep!""  

It was right after this that she blew right past my stop.  I don't know what her problem is but maybe she shouldn't be taking her personal problems out on us old folks.  I guess I am lucky I was sitting sideways so she couldn't see me close my eyes or she would have admonished me for daring to close my eyes for a few seconds too.  I had no complaint about any other driver.  I do not normally ride the bus at all.  I used to have a disabled person card but I let it lapse because I was told I had to buy tickets 10 at a time and as I rarely go out that was not terribly useful to me.  This is the first time I was going to see my grandson in another state and had to get to the airport. A cab ride is $55 so I thought to ride the bus to the airport and back and did so successfully until this woman ignored my stop request and then blamed me for her mistake.  It wouldn't have made me so angry had she just said something like ""I'm sorry, I didn't hear the bell"", and then told me how far I would have to walk back instead of telling me she doesn't know where the stops are on her own route. There is no excuse for the way she treated me or the older man she so rudely chastised for daring to close his eyes.  And btw, are HER rules different from RTC rules?  Do her ""rules"" supersede the norms of polite society as well as RTC rules?  It took me 22 minutes to make that walk, which google thinks is a 7 minute walk - that would be because I am disabled. I was prepared to walk from the Mt. Babcock and Echo stop but not the Bismark and Echo stop.  I didn't even know where the stop where she finally let me out actually was, no idea how many stops she had passed after blowing past mine. I'm just lucky my phone worked this time so I could get hold of my son in another state to tell me where I was and how far I had to walk back to get to where I should have been to start with.

There are a BUNCH of complaints already here about treatment of the elderly and disabled. Clearly RTC doesn't give a crap, they just want to take in the grant money for supposedly providing support services to elderly/disabled without actually PROVIDING said services. I guess the fact that I am elderly AND disabled gave this woman free rein to treat me like something nasty stuck to the bottom of her shoe. RTC clearly agrees with her. You know, because someone for whom walking an extra block (or more since she wouldn't tell me) in the dark freezing windy cold on an unfamiliar street is a real problem, must be a subhuman who doesn't deserve air to breathe, let alone the use of her precious bus or any respect whatsoever.",2020-01-14 02:43:35,négatif,négatif

Wow! This place is awesome and will be my new go to place for all of my liquor needs. It is huge and has such a wide variety of stock. A growler and tasting bar is at the very back. I can't wait to come back and try that out. There is a massive line of beer coolers and you can get beers from all over. There is a gluten free beer section as well. They also have some singles so you can try out something new.   Wine and spirits take over a large chunk of the store. Great selections. Lots of alcohol related gifts and gadgets too.

Two needs improvement. The first is the pricing on the wine list. The mark up is egregious. I don't mind paying a mark up as businesses have to make money however this was ridiculous. 

The second needs improvement is on bar service. They are totally understaffed and have a bad attitude, possibly from understaffing as they were hustling really hard during happy hour. This shows up by them not making eye contact with you and literally having to almost physically grab them to get a drink. 

I ordered a gin and tonic which tasted awful, bad tonic water that tasted like chlorine and no quinine, I had a really hard time getting their attention and my colleague was ready for his second drink before we were able to finally flag them over. The bartender then was a little put out that I didn't want the drink and still left it on the tab. They took it off after implying that I drank it, really?

I've had cuts ranging from a simple trimming of bangs (which took, incidentally, a mere five minutes and looked exactly as I requested), to giving shape and definition to a formless, tangled mass of chest-length hair, to shearing off several inches of the aforesaid mass to achieve an angled bob effect - all looked, in a word, perfect. Frances has an uncanny ability to look at a photo and reproduce the hairstyle depicted without fail. Before discovering this hidden gem of a salon, I'd never gotten a haircut that I felt looked good straightaway (normally it needs a few weeks to grow out before I grow fond of it), but Perfect Cut has spoiled me in that department. Also, unlike a good number of other stylists I've encountered, Perfect Cut doesn't inundate your hair with handfuls of product/blow-dry it to within an inch of its life before you depart (resulting in a look which, though attractive, is invariably short-lived and impossible to replicate). What you get when you walk out the door is more or less what you'll see the next morning after some time with a hairbrush.

2. Yeah they have some activities that cost extra. Who cares? Most are outside vendors that Sweetfields has come in so, they expect to make some money. $5 pony rides, $5 for face painting, food, pumpkin patch, Apple cider and lemonade (worth every mother effing penny!).

3. There is way more that you can do for free. They have a lot of animals, a corn maze, hayride, bales of hay, a play house, ""play ground,"" and lots of other games. You could easily come here and not spend another dime. Cornhole, 2 huge tires and 4 bales of hay entertained my 3 year old for nearly an hour. What can I say? We're city folk! ‍

4. It's really well maintained and the staff is super helpful and the animals are well cared for. Also they have clean Port O Pottys. You read that right. CLEAN PORT O POTTYS. I always thought that was an oxymoron but these people pay staff to stand outside of the bathrooms and clean after each use. Not all heroes wear capes. 

5. The food options are good. They had a few food trucks with options like BBQ, pizza, etc. All of it looked good and there was no carnival food. We enjoyed our lunch there before leaving. 

6. Like all fall events in this area, it gets busy. That's just the way it is. But whether you go here or anywhere else you are going to deal with crowds. Floridians rejoice when it is finally ""fall"" and nothing is going to stop them from heading to pumpkin patches in droves. So don't go or plan accordingly! 

7. Did I mention the lemonade? Oh, I did. Well, I'm mentioning it again because OH.MY.GOD. It was so good! It's pricy but it comes in a mason jar so it just tastes better. GET IT. 

We drove about 60 Miles (one way) to go here and no regrets. It's on our list for next year.",2017-10-28 18:51:37,positif,positif

- Pork soup dumplings (amazing!! skip the wait at Dim Sum Garden if thats all you're going for)

- Create your own Hot Pot
- Ma po tofu (vegetarians be aware, there is pork in the sauce)

We arrived at Honey's at around 11am. There was, as expected, a line. It wasn't a big deal. It was gorgeous and sunny outside, there were benches (well, planters with wide edges), and the hostess lowballed the expected time, so we were pleasantly surprised to only wait half the time she stated. Our table was squeezed in between two others, but the noisiness of the place actually provided more privacy than if it had been silent. We set about reading the menu. It was extensive and slightly confusing (they provide you will all the menus, including dinner, although many of the dishes on it can't be ordered before 5pm), but it had a lot of tantalizing options. Pear-Nutella french toast? Brisket sandwich? Chorizo desayuno? I wished I was in a bigger group of people so I could sample more dishes. 

I ordered the chicken-fried steak and eggs, while my friend got the Breakfast Bomb, which is advertised as ""a buttermilk pancake stuffed with scrambled eggs and your choice of breakfast meat"". We cracked our beers (BYOB) and settled in for a good long wait. And I mean looong. Boy howdy. That food took nearly an hour. 

In the end, the eggs were delicious but the chicken-fried steak was a sad disappointment. I didn't eat more than a couple of bites, as it was overcooked, soggy, and almost totally unseasoned. The Breakfast Bomb was a good choice, though--I tried that and I highly approve. Like a McGriddle but made out of real food.

There's a bank of america down the street if you need it. Secondly, La Viola Ovest is right across the street from La viola (regular type).. I don't quite get why the owner would want to pay rent on two locations, but that's his decision. La viola Ovest is open on Mondays--I think the decor of LVO is much nicer, with a more open tablescape. The lighting is also much nicer. We went to dinner at around 6 PM, and the restaurant was half full. By the time we left at around 7, it was completely full-- so make reservations if you plan on visiting any time after 6. 

As far as food goes, I was completely satisfied. We ordered the Penne alla caruso ($10), which is a penne pasta in a slightly creamed tomato vodka sauce with peas and pancetta. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the sauce was not overpowering. The pancetta was a bit on the salty in 1 inch chunks, which I wasn't a fan of, but if you like pancetta, you'll like it. We also got a chicken dish ($14) topped with prosciutto, asparagus, and fontina cheese. The chicken was moist and when you got the perfect bite of chicken, asparagus and proscuitto, it was heaven. The dish came in a mild tomato sauce with braised lettuce and potato. 

Overall value is great, as portions were more than adequate with a low price tag. I find that some Italian places have a tendency to provide behemoth amounts of food for a $$$-- which to me, isn't worth it. Instead, LVO allows you to eat like a human and leave with some dignity. The specials sounded really good too, there was a special squid ink pasta dish served with a lobster tail that sounded really good, but again-- I felt weary about getting a dish with ""lobster tail,"" because most places give you a tiny morsel with you guessed it, a 100% markup.

This visit to Maplewood, however, was just sub par. I walked in before it was too busy. I had my 1.5 year old with me. The girl (who acted like she may have been a manager) took our order and seemed annoyed that my friendly son was trying to talk to her. She also seemed annoyed that I was asking questions about options on the kids menu. I finally settled on something for my son because I didn't want to hold up the line. I asked for no cheese on my spud but it still had cheese, and I thought ""oh it was an honest mistake"". My son and I enjoyed the food otherwise, but I was disappointed that we sat in our booth (that was only the second one away from the register so very close to the front) for over 30 minutes and not one of the 3 workers came to get empty dishes, refill drinks, or even offer a friendly smile. At one point I started counting how many times they would walk by us without saying anything and it went over 15 times until I stopped counting. I needed to get a bowl for my son's leftovers but since no one could be bothered by us, I had to literally pack up my belongings, pick up my curious boy, and head back up to the counter to ask for a bowl. The guy who was there again seemed annoyed that I would even ask for one. I told him I also needed to place an order to go, which he took. I had to wait for another 7-10 minutes for my order to get ready which meant another 7-10 minutes of my very curious son risking irritating the folks in this fine establishment. One final thing- when I asked the girl from before if my son was supposed to get a cookie with his kids meal, she told me they were out of the mini cookies and told me I could take a big one for him. Well, thanks I guess but don't make this my fault, lady. Perhaps they would just rather have the teenagers and adults whom they were much friendlier to, than a mom and her adorable little boy?

After reading the reviews, my hopes were high for a city-like dining experience out here.  Arugula did a pretty great job! 

We made our reservations day-of via open table and the earliest we could get was 9 PM.  The restaurant was very full when we arrived.  It's cute inside and you can see the kitchen.  Low lighting- nice for a date.  Lots of larger parties there so clearly they accommodate groups.  Arugula does a great job of reminding you that they're a BYOB so bring that wine.

We started out with one of their specials- a soft mozzarella with pesto and tomatoes.  It was so good!  We also ordered the broccoli rabe con salcicca which was amazing.  I was nervous about sweet veal sausage but it was delicious.  I wasn't starving so I ordered the insalata arugula and it was wonderful- loved the hearts of palm.  My dining partner got the pollo capri which he really enjoyed.

Why not 5 stars?  Our server was kind of a jerk.  The food was definitely delicious but it wasn't something that was so good that I'm dying to go back right away.  Is it worth a shot?

I was in town for the weekend and heard from multiple sources that Pesche was not to be missed. I'm a big fan of Butcher and Cochon, so was excited to try the group's spin on seafood. 

My husband and I decided to go for apps and drinks. We did not have a reservation but from other reviews saw that the bar area is first come first serve (and offers the full food menu). We arrived around 7pm on a Saturday and luckily grabbed the last bar seats available (thanks to the hostess who gave us the tip on who was being seated next). The place was already fairly crowded and continued to fill up as the night went on, so we were happy we got a spot. The atmosphere at the bar and the restaurant was very cozy with some cool rustic decor. 

The bartenders were awesome- very attentive and gave solid recommendations. We ordered a half dozen oysters - Local 3 from Louisiana ($1.35/oyster) which were surprisingly very large. We immediately wanted more. The bartender suggested that we add some of the Dauphin Island ($2.75/oyster) to the next order. Those were delicious - very clean and well worth the additional price.  We also got the crab leg small plate (great flavors) and the fried bread with seat salt app (yum!). For drinks we tried some of the gin cocktails and were impressed. Can't speak to the mains, and thus the four as opposed to five star rating, but everything coming out looked amazing.

I've only been once but my sandwich was delicious! I ordered the IPA Braised Beef and it was perfect. Amazing beef quality and the toppings were subtle and well-placed. The bread was soft and complimented the overall ingredients well. 
Only complaint I have is the value..My sandwich was $9 and much smaller than anything I would have gotten downtown. I understand fully well that local, quality ingredients are going to cost a bit more but I'm accustomed to paying the same amount and getting chips or soup and a drink with a much larger sandwich.

We didn't have a problem getting 3 to 4 companies to come out to our house and review the work we needed done, but getting them to get back to us with a quote was nearly impossible.  ARS was prompt to come take a look and give us a quote in a timely manner.  The first quote was severely underestimated which was good for us, but it was so low and unfair to them that we let them give us a second quote.  Again, they mistakenly set the quote too low, but they were willing to honor it so we went ahead and hired them.

We needed a new furnace, extensive new duct work snaking through the low pitched attic, new intake and return vents in every room and the old furnace moved to the garage and installed with a new gas line running from the house to the garage.  Most companies weren't willing to do that much work, and some wanted us to get a subcontractor to dig the gas line.  ARS did it all for under $7,000.00 (including the price of the new, Amana, top-of-the-line, energy efficient, furnace which cost $4,500.00) which was at least $3,000.00 less than anyone else.  Little did they know that our ceiling had at 5 layers and one of them was metal.  They broke three saw blades cutting holes to install the vents, and I'm sure it took 5 times as long.  It took two guys 2.5 days to finish everything.  If they didn't lose money doing this job, I'd be shocked.

Now for the complaints.  They did not put tarps in any of the rooms when they cut through the ceiling so we had drywall chunks and dust everywhere covering everything, including our beds and carpeting.  They did not put tarps on the floor so we have muddy footprints on all the floors and carpeting.  If we had known they weren't going to cover anything, we would have done it ourselves.  They hand dug the gas line from the house to the garage and hit a cable while doing so.  We could see that they had frayed the cable, but instead of telling us or fixing it, they tried to bury it again with dirt.  After they were done, we noticed that two of the vents weren't blowing air properly.  We crawled into the attic and found that they hadn't attached the duct to the vents securely so we went around and did all that.  Our ducts are super noisy when the heater kicks on.  We're trying to figure out what the problem is with the dampers since adjusting them hasn't helped.

In summary, we got what we paid for and we may have even gotten a bargain.  We did get a guarantee that says we can call them, if we're not satisfied with their work, and they will come out and fix the problem.  We have an amazing warranty on the furnance.  The project manager was knowledgable, personable and came out to check on the project twice.  I'm sure we weren't a priority, and the guys were probably told to rush the job which is why we have some slight problems, but we'd hire them again at that price.",2012-02-01 18:04:23,neutre,négatif

First of all, I appreciate a hot sandwich shop being open this late as their 10pm nightly closing is clearly posted on the door.

The store looks simple and without clutter featuring the blue and red colors of Kruk's longtime team. I was familiar with this space from the previous sub shop tenant and Kruk's makes better use of the space.

Employees were terrific to me, answering my questions about the store and a couple specific menu items that were new to me like ""broccoli rabe.""

My ""Pepper Cheesesteak"" featuring sweet peppers and wiz (I also added tomato at no upcharge) was made fast. Both the meat and bread definitely had the flavor and texture of an authentic philly steak sandwich. 

Next time, I will ask to go slightly heavier on the wiz because I want to taste more of that signature ingredient.

Because it was Kruk's ""Opening Day,"" an appropriate term for a place featuring the name of a longtime major baseball player, all sandwiches were just $5.

Even though Kruk's is brand new to Tampa, the first store opened two years ago and there are now six locations from here to Naples.

I'm told John Kruk should be making an personal appearance at an official grand opening here in the near future.

Not only will he talk about the restaurant, but you will want to hear his story about facing Randy Johnson in the All-Star Game at Camden Yards.

JjRFbw41a7r3dXEmXzD3nA,OLGQ7alK4VKl3YdQk6UF5g,zLm2PaYrpHkcr63ekwvtBQ,3,4,3,0,"I was super psyched for my first bike ride of the season when suddenly I heard a pop when pumping up my front tire. I wasn't going to let a flat get in my way so dragged my bike down to Philadelphia Bikesmith. 

They were able to look at my bike right away and the cost to fix the tire was only $7. The whole process took about 20-30 minutes.  They also took a look at my back tire and pumped it while I was there. 

In the end of the day I have no complaints about the result of the work, but there were a few things that rubbed me the wrong way.

First, the girl working on my bike took a phone call while working on my bike and joked about it to the person on the other end of the call and in the others in shop. I'm all for double-tasking, but that just made me a little nervous since my safety was at hand. Maybe this happens all the time at shops everywhere. I just didn't like that it was happening right in front of me. 

She also took the liberty to grease my chains without permission. This took my total bill up to $12. If she asked me I most likely would have authorized this work since my safety was at stake, but she absolutely should have asked me before doing this. 

She was very nice and gave me some tips on how to pump since it's been a while and I'm still sort of new to my bike. I just wasn't thrilled with everything that went down during my visit. At least I was able to get a quick fix and get out on the road in the same day.

***Edit: I did misunderstand the pricing structure. I was accurately charged and can now appreciate the complimentary lubing. However, at the time of my visit, Sarah did not appear to be working on anything or drop what she was doing to fix my flat. At the time I entered the store, she was sitting at the front register. I can't speak to what she had been doing prior to that. Secondly, while my bike was in the stand, she was still working on it while on the phone. My concern wasn't that my bike would be dropped, it was that her attention was split. Maybe that was her 10,000th tire fix and she can change them in her sleep, but that won't take away the nervous feeling I got during my visit.",2015-04-13 15:50:52,neutre,neutre

Sales exec (Jeff) came to our home, took measurements and showed us some pictures online to choose from. This was at the beginning of the COVID outbreak so we appreciated being able to choose a product from home. Jeff was helpful, polite and we were able to select a product and purchase our doors that day. We signed a contract and put 1/2 down. 

About 12 weeks later, the windows arrived and were ready for install. 
Install was scheulded in a timely manner and two lovely men by the names of Adam and Ryan came out two days in a row to get our new sliding glass doors installed. We purchased five panels in total, suffice it to say, it was an expensive venture and we were excited.

Unfortunately, once installed, the locks/handles on the doors literally would not work. We could not get in or out of our home. My strong husband, the two installation experts and myself struggled for more than ten minutes with each handle. The installation folks told us that they were ""genuinely surprised we had ordered these handles as they typically don't work and are not popular...."". We were, of course shocked. Why on earth would anyone sell us something that didn't work? I called the store to speak to the sales manager and explained what was going on. I calmly explained that I would not be paying the balance of the invoice until I could actually operate my doors. He asked me ""who was your sales rep?"", ""did you come into the store""?.....Of course I didn't come into the store we were in a quarantine and as I'm not an idiot I wouldn't have spent thousands and thousands of dollars on doors that don't work. Four days later the manager and one of the sales folks come out to the house to ""fix"" the handles. They basically removed them and soddered them down so that they would open and close properly. There was no apology. There was no offer to compensate for our trouble. I asked if we could please have different handles and was told if we wanted different handles we would need to buy completely new (three thousand dollar doors). 

I was told by the installation techs that if we review they get a bonus. I want to reiterate they did nothing wrong so Ryan and Adam deserve that bonus! As for Jesse, Dave and the sales exec that I never saw again.....they need to learn how to run a business. Do not make the mistake that we did and avoid this company. Doors and windows in FL are expensive and these types of investements should be treated as carefully as the customers.",2020-09-25 16:46:34,négatif,négatif

My car was not very dirty at all other than that. Paid $100 for the interior shampoo. After having my car for three hours I was expecting my car to be nice and clean... Boy was I disappointed. I immediately pointed out to the guy that my car still smelled like Puke and did not have a hint of shampoo smell at all. I also pointed out the smears on the windows along with the dirt all over the body of the car. They directed me to drive my car back through the car wash. I did then while they were redrying my car I requested the manager. I pointed out the chunks of Puke in the floor of the car. They were claiming they shampooed everything yet nothing was damp and it didn't even look like it had been vacuumed! The manager agreed, he took my car and attempted to reshampoo my car in 10 minutes which resulted in my passenger window control being broken. I went from being unhappy to livid!! I demanded to talk to whoever was higher than him immediately. The manager called his boss on the phone and I told him everything that had happened. He apologized immensely and asked me to bring my car back in the morning. He even offered to pick my car up at my work if need be! The next morning I drop off my car again and the man I spoke with on the phone was there. He personally hand washed, shampooed, and waxed my car. When I came to pick it up he gave me $100 in free car washes to make up for what I had gone through.

(1) Food:Chef was sick. He kept wiping his nose on his hands while he was making our sushi. It was disgusting.
(2) Food: Sushi / sashimi pieces were very small. We had to eat another meal after (somewhere else). Also, they gave us kind of an odd selection of fish, which makes one wonder if they serve whatever is the cheapest catch of the day.
(3) Service: We asked for soy sauce. They refused to give it to us because they said that they put it on the fish themselves. I prefer traditional sushi, so this wasn't great.
(4) Advice: There were no other customers. There's no reason to make a reservation on Resy. (They charge you $30 per person for canceling if you don't cancel with more than 24 hour notice.) 
(5) Service: When we didn't want to eat something, the chef kept yelling at us to eat it. I personally don't like this level of personalized attention at a restaurant. Also, I think he tries to tell you what they are serving, but the person's English & Japanese is not great, so it's impossible to know what they are serving. Maybe if you speak Chinese, then you might have a better experience?
(6) The ""vibe"" is not good. 

Bill:
There are also two surprises when you get the bill at the end. (1) They charge you $5 for fresh wasabi (without telling you that they will at any point in the meal or on the menu).

1. If you have a website, keep it updated!

2. If you list what is on the food on the menu, make it the way it says! I ordered the Low Carb Burger, no bun ( they don't have any gluten free options they are sure of) it stated it was served on a bed of lettuce & tomato with a balsamic dressing & topped with grilled mushrooms, grilled onions & provolone.

I asked them to just bring me the lettuce & tomato on the side which they did, I took the peppers off. My husband ordered the Patty Melt which also stated grilled onions & cheese.

When I saw this was a building with exhibits based on archival research, artifacts presented with historical context, and top notch audiovisual displays, I was disappointed. How will I learn anything, I wondered, without a giant statue of a rando army dude erected 80 years after the war's conclusion, charging on top of a big metal horsey with a descriptive plaque that barely constitutes a comprehensive sentence? Surely one cannot learn history without looking into the deep stone cold eyes of a dead general with a powerful nickname like ""Psycho Wolf"" or ""Battle Stallion."" However, this museum proves that you don't need monuments to remember facts. What a relief! I can finally stop erecting statues for every item on my grocery list. 

Seriously though, the professionals in charge of this new museum deserve an enormous hand. This is how you do present a truly inclusive history. There is a separate exhibit just on the Native Americans and their decision making process as to who to support in the revolution. This is in addition to Native Americans being mentioned throughout the museum. Lots of attention is paid to the role of African Americans, including an in depth discussion of the idea of slavery and how it fits (and doesn't fit) with the equality touted by the revolutionary colonists. I loved hearing about black loyalists and the British effort to ignore the stipulation in the treaty to return runaway slaves and instead resettle black loyalists in Nova Scotia. I would love to see a more in depth exhibit on that humanitarian effort, maybe in collaboration with some Canadian institutions. What I particularly liked about this approach is it didn't simply focus on the American point of view. Almost half of the exhibits approached the revolution from a British point of view, telling stories from loyalist colonists, British soldiers, Hessian mercenaries, and British officials. I really loved that in some of the interactive displays an effort was made to show HOW we can actually know some of the information, especially since many of those involved left no personal written record (also, no monuments). 

We were told to not miss the film on Washington's tent, but honestly, this was by far the least interesting part of the museum, especially since you couldn't really see the tent of get close to it. It was almost have made more sense to have a recreation tent you could physically walk through after the movie. Don't believe the hype, the tent movie isn't that great, and here's basically all you need to know:
The tent symbolizes that Washington, unlike other generals of his time, wanted to be seen as ""one of the common people"" so he pitched his tent out in field with his troops. Of course, his tent was enormous and luxurious by comparison. By modern camping standards, it's like at least an 8-person tent, and a regular solider tent be smaller than your average 2-person dome tent. But, he was out there in the cold with everyone else, so soldiers trusted him, and that trust continued with his cult of personality into his presidency and beyond. Washington died, his tent was passed onto Martha, and then eventually her grandaughter, Mary Custis Lee, wife of Robert E. Lee (of statue fame). After the Civil War, she sold the tent to a collector to pay for relief for confederate widows. Eventually the tent made it's way to the museum. The End. I now saved you 15 minutes. 

So, all in all, excellent museum, despite the lack of monuments, and Washington's Tent is fine, you can totally miss it and not lose anything in your life.",2017-08-30 18:40:17,positif,positif

I would even settle for retractable, but closed roof is no fun.  I was at a game yesterday on a beautiful sunny fall day, and it would have greatly enhanced the experience.  Since Green Bay, Mizzou and many others have this, I don't think we can use weather as an excuse! 
Security getting in is tight, and I think they overdo it a bit.  Closing down the major streets around the dome and cops everywhere?  Bomb sniffing dogs, clear purses, and handheld wands?  Maybe this is the wave of the future, but it seems over the top for a regular season game.  The additional security slows entry into the dome quite a bit, so be sure to plan enough time to accommodate this if you want to see kick off.  
Once in, the structure is pretty basic and utilitarian. Little to no character or special design.  It is well marked and easy to navigate, so getting to your seat is easy.  
Concessions are pricey, but no worse than other similar venues.  Offerings are pretty standard snacks and beverages like beer, soda, popcorn, pretzels, nachos, etc.  Beer is beer, so that was fine, but mostly just AB products are offered.  The food leaves a lot to be desired.  Low quality salty or sugary junk food, without many fresh-made or upgrade options.  
The sound and lighting systems are also sub-par.  You can barely hear what is going on and there is always just a lot of overall ""white noise"" that reverberates around the building (which would be helped by the above mentioned open air setup).  The lighting is similar to a casino- tons of LED, flashing lights, and bright colors.  I don't know how the players concentrate, and it was tough for me.  As I am typing this, it sounds crazy to me, but I prefer to watch a game at a bar or even at home where I can better control my surroundings, clearly see each play, and hear what is going on as it happens.  It's never a good sign when we are at the game in good seats, but have to watch instant replays on the big screen every time to understand what is happening right in front of us!",2013-11-04 17:42:16,négatif,neutre

Well I could keep going, but my only point is, this isn't the largest zoo, but they have a wealth of animals and plants with origins all over the world. 

My favorite part of this zoo is definitely the penguin and puffin exhibit.  When you enter the cove of the penguins, you'll experience the heartwarming surprise that can only be experienced when you've had a penguin shake water onto your face.  The bird house is also spectacular.  

The zoo is divided into different zones, and maps are plentiful to guide you on your trek.  I've been a few times, and appreciate the warmth of the staff, and the chance to see the animals.  Okay so I've been to a few exhibits, where theres a little sign that reminds me of the computer with the thermometer indicating an unhealthy animal, but what does that show, but a zoo that values the health and well being of their animals.  

Parking on our visit was $10, and affords you footbridge access in, or you can street park for free as other's have mentioned.  I was wearing a pedometer, and from the spot we got, we walked about 1/3 mile from our spot to the entrance.  Not too shabby.

Being that it was a Monday, reservations were definitely not needed. We sat outdoors next to the stone fountain in their new(?) patio area and although it was a little chilly and a little difficult to imagine that you are not sitting in a former parking lot, it was for lack of better descriptive terms, nice.

Pros: The side of green chili mac 'n' cheese was hands-down dope. I would almost recommend ordering two of these and calling it an entree. But then you'd have to order a side of two other entrees because the scallops and the duck that we ordered were also done quite well. The gnocchi that the duck sits on melts in your mouth. We also ordered the special appetizer, mussels. What was remarkable was that each mussel was served with its own sprinkling of ground up chorizo, tomato, and some thick, but delicate green sauce (sorry, don't remember the details of this one). Service was warm and pleasant. And at the end of the night, my husband asked, ""How is it that I lived across the street for a year and never came here to drink alone?""

Cons: You have to walk through a bunch of BMWs to get to the front door.",2010-09-28 13:27:24,positif,neutre

Ambiance: The atmosphere is very cute. There is a bar area and then there is a more sit and dine area on the second level. The available games to play with other people are a nice touch to be more casual and interactive. The dim lighting and seating yourself policy also contributes to the casual feel of the place.

Food: To be quite honest, I was underwhelmed by the desserts. I have been at the Bakery Bar twice and had tried 3 cake slices between those two cakes. The cakes look gorgeous, beautifully crafted with each layer separated. There are also many options and the options change on a daily basis, which is a definite plus. However, the taste for all the cakes I have tried (Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Confetti, Carrot Cake) were all okay. There was not anything particularly great about the taste. It was moderately moist and sweet and had the flavoring of the cake. That was pretty much it. I felt the cake batter could have been made from any other mid-level bakery. The cake slices definitely seemed to be more picture-worthy than palate-satisfying. Likewise, I had order a cake layered creme brulee. Again, the cake seemed to be quite normal and average, taking away from the taste of the creme brulee.

Service: I did not sit at the bar either times I was there but I can say that the waiter/waitress service for the tables are timely and efficient. The moment we sat down, a waiter or waitress would come and greet us, hand us our menus, and pour water into glasses. We had to order cakes and cake pops at a little area next to the bar but there was a separate menu for additional dess9ert. Orders were taken quickly and processed efficiently. Cake slices were also brought to our table at a timely pace.

Final thoughts: Overall, the environment is a nice and quaint, casual space. The food was underwhelming for its beautiful look but the service was timely and efficient.",2018-06-26 05:56:41,neutre,positif

If you do, please be very, very careful. I bought a 2006 BMW 650i and after a short while I realized that it smoked a lot after idling (like a huge puff of smoke). I took it to a BMW specialist, who told me that it is a known problem with the model and that it involved the valve stem seals, which need to be changed. This is a $4200 job at the specialist and about $7-8000 at BMW. In other words a huge repair on top of what I already paid for a car, that they said had been through a 60 point inspection, which clearly was useless.

I thought I was safe, since The Great Britains offered a warranty of the power train. So of course I assumed that the valves would be covered as they are clearly part of the power train. They are not. In fact the warranty they offer is useless. It only covers parts that don't break. Like the cylinder or pistons. These will never break unless you operate the car without oil in it, in which case the warranty is void anyways. 

In short the warranty covers none of the parts that will break on your car. I spoke with a shop who also had issues with this warranty company. He agreed that it is not worth the paper it is written on.

So, I contacted George Weldon of The Great Britains and told him of the issue. I asked if there was any way The Great Britains would be able to assist me with the repair since they had sold me a defect car. They basically told me: tough luck. There has been absolutely zero assistance or flexibility on their part.

I am very disappointed and now I have to pay $4200 for a repair on a car I just bought from them.. So like I said i can not recommend them at all! The fact that they sell a car with a defect shows their incompetence, that their warranty is good for nothing, shows their cynicism and the fact that they are not willing to help out at all after this shows their complete lack of customer service.

They give used car sellers a bad name!",2014-07-13 03:04:11,négatif,négatif

iPho, we were so pleased to see you land in our neighborhood. Vietnamese food! In Fairmount!  We wanted to support your arrival in Fairmount.  But we were so disappointed by the reception on our first visit, we decided to leave before ordering.
Basic customer service was seriously lacking. 101 for a restaurant host is to smile, greet the customer warmly and provide them with some helpful info (or better yet, a table!). Do not leave them flailing by the door, and then shove them on the window counter, when there is space for at least another 8 people at tables (because you haven't figured out how to separate two tables for 2).  The hostess was neither friendly, nor did she seem to have a clue.
Once seated at the window, we were told that it would be a 30 min wait to throw together a bun.  It was 9pm, so hardly dining rush hour.  And it's bun, so most of the ingredients are cold!  We cut our losses and went to the fun Japanese BBQ place on Callowhill instead.  
Ok, we get that it was opening week. Mistakes get made. It's busy.  But employ staff who have basic customer service skills and treat local customers with some courtesy, otherwise they won't come back. 
We're going to give the delivery / takeout service a go this evening.  But if that fails, we won't be returning.  Customer service really matters in a big city like Philly. There are heaps of other great places to eat that have customer service down, so if you want to compete, let alone be a loved neighborhood eatery, fix this, and quick!

UPDATE on takeout - Zero customer service on the phone either. We're going to Pho Cali in Chinatown instead - ten mins wait for takeout bun and noodle soup (they know how to run a takeout business).  We might try iPho again in a few weeks, if reviews suggest they've got their act together.",2016-03-03 00:06:47,négatif,négatif

We were seated and greeted promptly be our server, I wish I could remember his name because he did a great job, checking on us regularly and was very friendly and engaging. 

The food was subpar, I didn't think the crepes and potatoes were very good and wished I would have ordered something else. My wife ordered the special griddle cakes and those were better and they also come with Eggs, toast and a meat side.

The kids meal choices were pretty good and overall everything was reasonably priced.

Our food took longer than expected but they brought out some fresh muffins to hold us over which was nice and the server checked on us several times to make sure we were ok.

Overall I wouldn't come here expecting much (it is a chain) but it does the job and I think if you stick to something simple you won't be greatly disappointed. I will say I remembered the food being a lot better last time I came a few years back and was a little disappointed by the quality this time. The Muffins are great and the service made up for it and I think you have to know what you are getting going to a chain like Mimi's

The biggest pieces of artichoke you've ever seen! It was hard to taste ANYTHING else. And out of the entire experience, yes this is what sticks out in my mind the most. 

But let me start from the beginning. We walked in and I really liked how the place looks. There's a clear ""bar"" section as well as a clear ""restaurant"" section. I wanted to be a bit more cozy so we opted for a booth in the dining area. Now that we did, I wish we would have sat at a table in the bar section. If I remember right, they have lots of windows on that side. We sat in a 2 person booth and it ended up being way to small by the time our food was on the table. 

We started with the spicy spinach artichoke. It is basically a piece of bread with spinach and artichoke dip on top. The bread tasted like dough, not flavorful or good. And the artichokes were so huge and overpowering it was hard to enjoy any of it! I did like the tiny taste of ""creamy spinach"" I got. I probably would never order this again. 

I opted for a wedge salad and a pizza but the waitress said ""the wedge salad is huge, are you sure you want that?"" Well, now that you mention it, no! So instead I went with a Cesar salad. It was completely drenched in Cesar dressing. Yuck. 

I got the pesto chicken and artichoke pizza. Another mistake. The artichokes were once again huge and overpowering. The pesto was ok and the chunks of chicken were huge. Won't order it again. 

My husband got the patty melt and loved it. He specifically commented on the caramelized onions with the house sauce saying it was perfection. He also ordered the truffle fries and was so excited about them. He said they lacked flavor and I agreed. 

So if this was my experience, why would I be back? Well, because I think this place has potential. The bar is huge and I had a cosmo that was absolutely awesome! They have a huge selection of beer as well and after reading the reviews on yelp, it sounds like they have a great happy hour!

I don't think too many people come here though, because it's all the way on the south side, and for most of the local population that's far. But for those of us who do live on this side of town, it's great. And being in the south, it's one of the newer malls in Edmonton as well.

They have some unique stores that you can only find here, like the Science Shop and RW&Co. Other stores include Sears, The Bay, Gap, American Eagle, Stokes, and Lord's Shoes. You'll also find many services here, from medical and dental to banking and hair salons. They have major hair salons here like Hennessy and Eveline Charles. There's also a Safeway attached to the mall.

While they don't have much in terms of mall entertainment like West Ed does, they still offer a lot for shopping. There's a mix of high end brand stores with more affordable shops for those who don't want to spend too much. It's all about the shopping here at Southgate.

They're undergoing some huge renovations right now, since the city is planning on expanding the LRT and connecting it to Southgate. Needless to say, the roads outside the mall are currently a big mess, and they recently moved the bus terminal across the street, closer to the mall.

The green beans were super.  The service was excellent. The restaurant is inside of a historic mansion. So when you're done eating you can walk around and look inside the house.

Third, they try to tell you that there are new tolls on the highways and that you'll be charged a much higher rate after the fact and get you to sign up on their service, this is a smaller scaled scam- do your research on your route(s). Fourth, upon returning the vehicle, Brian A was literally kicking the bumpers to inspect the car and even lifted up the hood- seriously?! He found a ""crack"" in the windshield, thus the ridiculous scam and fraud ensued. Brian A and Pony (a joke who calls himself a manager) saw us coming a mile away and tried to force me to sign papers saying I was in an accident and fraudulently charged my credit card $500 without my consent for the ""deductible"".

There were to receptionists and only one was handling a customer, the other just looked at me and said nothing. 

Second time, I was determined to try a cut and this time it wasn't crowded, the smell wasn't bad so I stayed, and the girls at the front desk were both friendly. The stylist was very polite but very disorganized, dropping things and having trouble with the chair, her table not ready with the tools she needed - but she was a student so I opted to ignore. All I wanted was a blunt cut and the length just above my shoulders, no bangs. She was going to start cutting without washing my hair so I asked, and she said, ok and she did a good job with the wash - but I'm not sure about the shampoo and conditioner because it kind of burnt my scalp or maybe the sink was not well rinsed after previous use - but I chose not to mention it.

The girl was very careful which I thought was a good sign and asked me several times if it was all right. I thought she should have cut off more but since my hair was wet I thought I'd play it safe and just go with it. After she was done, her instructor came to check the work, did a few extra snips and said it was good - and I believed her.

When I came home, dried and straightened my hair making it about the same length as when it was wet and being cut - I saw it was the most UNEVEN CUT of any place I've ever been to in my life - and I've had student cuts elsewhere too, but never like this. Blocks of hair in all different lengths, a whole group of hair that never got trimmed, what an embarrassing mess. I chose this place because it was a simple job and a supervisor would do a final check - but if the instructor couldn't get it right for a simple straight cut this is a total fail regardless of the price. 

And now that I think back, that sink where my hair was washed may not have been totally clean of chemicals when I had my hair washed hence the burning sensation . I do not recommend.",2015-02-20 21:03:13,négatif,négatif

My husband and I showed up 5pm on a Friday without reservations, but were happy to find that the bar was wide open with plenty of seats for the taking and the option to order off the dinner menu. It was certainly busy by the time it was 6 p.m. so be sure to either make a reservation for a table well in advance, or get there early enough to snag bar seating. 

Food-wise, it's tough being a vegetarian looking for a fine dining experience in the south. But, 5th & Taylor at the very least provided a great atmosphere and enough options for us to piece together a full meal. We ordered the beet salad, asparagus, Brussel sprouts, mushrooms and the cauliflower steak entree which was served with greens and mashed potatoes. I was super excited when I saw this offered on the menu, but it was just OK (as cauliflower steak usually is, in my personal cooking experience). The mashed potatoes were tasty but a bit too runny  -- when the server put them down on the bar my husband literally thought it was a soup, hah. Between all of the sides we ordered (and those potatoes), it was too much butter/oil for me and you bet I needed to pop some TUMS before bed. 

That being said, I would still go back in a heartbeat for the atmosphere, that delicious strawberry basil sangria and those Brussel sprouts -- I loved their unique take on them (mustard instead of balsamic vinegar!).

My husband came here Friday night around 8 for dinner. It was pretty busy for a Friday night in June.  We were seated promptly. The beer selection  is solid and anyone can find a style they like. They have a variety of pour sizes, which is good for those who do not like to commit. Unfortunately, flights are not available. They do have take out beer as well. Unlike the previous beer hall that occupied his space, there is also cocktails and spirits available. 

Since it was busy, it took a while for the server to come to our table. We put beer and food orders in. Some of the food came out quicker than our beers came. The bar seemed to be stacked with bartenders but very few servers on the floor. No wonder why the service was slow. 

The food is from food trucks currently. The food was heavy and filling, but overall not satisfying. In addition, it was very expensive for what it was. A six inch brisket cheesesteak with no side was $10. The truffle fries were $6 and pretty much the best part of the meal.

oBqnrcnC95AJA_iiNV71nA,ppsm8EDKjA1fp1yTCP3RrQ,ldr7iDtxFXX-q7tJuXqlGQ,4,2,0,2,"We will start with a disclaimer... my review is based on everything I got to try from the menu at the most recent Yelp Elite Event held here.  So when it comes to things such as quality of service or value for your money I can't speak to those things. It was a night where the food was served buffet style rather than table service. I will say that the staff was more than friendly to me the whole night, and the value was tremendous because I ate for free, so there.  

And in the interest of fairness, I will acknowledge that you're probably thinking to yourself that since I was treated to a free night, it might cloud my review.  I will assure you right up front that I will be as honest about the fare here as I possibly can.  Truth is, not everything completely wowed me.  But I'll also grade taking into account that food quality is always different in an atmosphere where it is served from catering trays rather than presented fresh from the kitchen to your table.  

Now, I can be a very detailed reviewer when I want to be, and truth is that I kept a nice little list of everything I sampled on my iPhone notepad.  So I'll just go straight into the list and review each dish I tried one by one.  Because in the end, I attend these events only so I can provide you the most detailed reviews possible.  By the way... you're welcome!  

Pizza... right off the bat, I'll tell you about the star of the menu.  The pizza here really is fantastic.  We spoke briefly to the chef, Luca Sena, Jr, and he seemed to take great pride in his pizza, especially the dough.  It is wonderfully fresh, no question, and it makes the entire pizza better.  The Margherita pizza was quite good, the sausage was better, but tonight he put out a seafood white pizza that quite honestly was out of this world.  I didn't see it on the regular menu listed on the website, but if it is available on the night you visit, I highly recommend it.  My wife also raved about the Margherita and the sausage. It was definitely her favorite dish of the night as well.  

Lasagna Cupcakes... they sound completely wonderful, don't they?  The concept is a lasagna base serving as the ""cake"", with ricotta ""icing"".  Very creative.  Truth is, they taste more basic than the concept.  But, I don't consider this a bad thing.  I sampled the sundried tomato ricotta lasagna, and it was good enough that I went back to try the truffle ricotta lasagna.  I do suspect that they might be a little fresher directly out of the kitchen, but they were definitely tasty.  Maybe not quite on the level of getting lasagna in a legit Italian restaurant.  

Guacamole and malanga chips... I love fresh guacamole done right, and this place does it right.  Another winner.  The malanga chips are a lighter taste than your basic corn tortilla chips, and most definitely the perfect compliment to the guac that they serve.  Great combination by the chef!

Braised short rib... another dish that I suspect would be a little better served from the kitchen rather than a serving pan, however it was very tender with a nice rich gravy.  

Salmon... I'm not sure if they served it in the same manner that they serve it on the menu, but it was a very fresh piece with a sweet tangy sauce.  

Seafood and Fregula... quite a unique dish.  I did enjoy the mix of seafood in the dish.  I'd probably enjoy a full dish of this right out of the kitchen.  

Tater tots... I have seen previous reviews and I know that this is popular.  I'll come out and say that the ones I tried were good.  But I wasn't overly wowed by them.  It could be that again they weren't served as fresh as normal.  I'm betting that they're much better right out of the fryer.  

Crab cannoli... this was a surprise.  They mix crab in with the Marscapone, fill a cannoli shell, and dust it with powdered sugar.  At least that's how they served it tonight.  On the menu they serve it with tomato sauce.  I applaud the creativity.  I'm going to say that this didn't work for me.  The tastes felt like they didn't fit together.  Maybe it's a personal taste.  

Tiramisu... this was definitely as good as any Tiramisu I've had at Italian restaurants.  You won't be disappointed.  

Chocolate ganache... my wife loved it.  I simply liked it.  I thought the chocolate could be a bit richer.  But I certainly finished it off happily.  

No complaints about the cocktails.  The wife and I both highly enjoyed hot apple cider with spiced rum on the heated patio.  It was a perfect combination and a fantastic atmosphere.  A taste of the house sangria also went down very smoothly.  

I can see where many would think the menu isn't on the same level as the finer places in Center City.  This place does seem to have a heavier bar atmosphere than a restaurant feel.  But overall, I thought there were more than enough quality items on the menu, especially the pizza.  I can see this place being a perfect choice for a gourmet pizza and a craft beer.

My significant other and I had seen plenty of raving reviews about Vyoone's - unsure if we hit it on the wrong night or what the case was. 

We had 6:30 reservations and snagged the last table in the courtyard, which had low, cushioned chairs - cushions were wet and being two gentlemen over 6 feet tall, the chairs were way too low to be comfortable. We had those swapped almost immediately. 

Someone came by to take a drink order, which took about 15 minutes for a Pimm's Cup and a Manhattan- drinks weren't bad but the service never got any better. The same host who sat us came by to tell us about the menu, and grab our order for an appetizer. 

Our cheeseboard came flying out of the kitchen- honestly in 5 minutes or less- but odd, right off the bat, being as I am from Wisconsin and know my way around a cheeseboard- why the two grilled baguettes for 7 pieces of cheese? The math just doesn't work out. 

After the cheeseboard, dinner went downhill- well I truthfully cannot even say that as our server/host (unsure who our server even was since we encountered two staff, however neither even introduced themselves) never returned to take our dinner order. After 45 minutes we asked for the check and decided to walk about without having dinner. 

When we brought this to the attention of the host- she did not seem concerned, and only asked if we would like our order taken by the time she came back to bring the bill. She noted they were short 4 servers (on a Friday night? That's an issue) - however this wasn't brought to our attention, again, until the bill was brought. Had she prefaced with that when she sat us on those wet courtyard chairs the first time- the tone of this review might be different. 

While I can't honestly review the food, the prices were steep ($50 for 2 drinks and cheeseboard with two pieces of bread). I wouldn't return, I wouldn't recommend based on the service, or lack their of, alone. Plus the ambiance is totally bizarre - for a place that has all of these raving reviews I wasn't expecting to walk into Christmas lights hanging from a hallway and purple lights lining the courtyard.

Prime rib - I have never tasted a piece of meat with such little flavor.

Usually there is a flavor crust on prime rib, there was nothing. 

Baked potato - while wrapped in tin foil it was so damn hot it was like they cooked it in a microwave. Plus they put nacho cheese on it which completely ruined it. 

The beans - these were the only thing with actual flavor however it tasted awful, it was basically baked beans in taco seasoning. I had one bite. 

The clam chowder - I was fighting with myself on whether to get the clam chowder or French onion. Should've went with the French onion. The soup was so bland I had to douse it in salt and pepper, there were barely any clams and it was definitely mass produced and not house-made.

Had been here many times when it was 312 and looked forward to trying it as really like the space. I didn't realize it was brunch only until 2pm so the menu was limited. I ordered the bbq wings as an appetizer and a brunch burger with fries for my meal. Wings were decent- could have used a couple more minutes in the fryer and less sauce. They were drowning in sauce. Burger was a smash patty and bland. Fries were blah (under seasoned and not crispy). We sat in the bar at a table. The bar area was busy and we were very happy with our server as he was very attentive (unfortunately he didn't tell us his name and it wasn't on the check).,2019-11-03 23:26:36,neutre,neutre

In addition to the Dino's girl, Crying Wolf owners also recruited a No. 308 bartender who knows mixed drinks. Tomato Fest gals mixed with hipster boys at the long TCW bar and at the smoking area outside on the big deck. The long bar is overlooked by a fierce looking Lone Wolf above. The wolf seemed to have a bit of a smirk, but maybe that was just the liquor on my imagination? The Wolf burger rocks, and so does the Dirt (not  Burt) Reynolds bacon/pepper/ jalapeno sausage. Good lounge food to go with good company at the Crying Wolf. The beer is affordable from the $3 PBR to the $6 Murphys Stout. The mixed drinks priced well to.

I'm an outside sales rep and go to a lot of restaurants and found out they opened about 5 min from my house and was looking forward to trying it out. I was really disappointed. First The waitress was extremely rushed and gave me the rundown and then wanted my order ASAP. My side (fried deviled eggs. Tasted good) came out a good bit before my burger so I had the choice to eat my side alone or let it get cold before my burger. The burger came out and was good as well. However scarcely had a finished my side the waitress had taken my side plate and asked me if I needed anything else.(I'd only been in the restaurant for like 10min at this point). Then about 5min later( I was partially through my burger she came by to take payment.) Her handhelds were acting up so she had to take 3 trips to get another and then told me if it didn't work this time I'd have to use a different card. After about 3 min of trying to get my card to go thru with a partially eaten burger on my plate she had me get up and go to the counter where the card reader finally worked. 

After about 16min in the restaurant I've paid $26 for a burger and side. Then I get my receipt and realize I've been charged 2.5% for using a credit card?

This is their 3rd location (University City and Glen Mills I believe were the others).  The concept is pretty cool and fresh - farm to table seasonal menu with most dishes under 500 calories.  It was hard for me to not make the comparisons to the Seasons 52 concept - SO many similarities, even down to the fire, wood, stone comfy decor.  But I am a fan of both places!

Vanilla lavendar mojito was unique and sweet, watermelon lemon martini was very smooth and not too sweet.

Waiter recommended basil pesto caprese flatbread was good.  Very flat (see pic) and light.  The other flatbreads looked compelling for a future visit - Jamaican jerk chicken and rock shrimp.

We tried the recommended Alaskan Halibut which we were told was a best of philly winner, and the cedar planked salmon.  Halibut was outstanding, on a bed of buckwheat soba noodles with a ginger teriyaki glaze.  Excellent taste and texture.  The salmon came out very well done (cedar was burned) and the waiter was quick to offer to take it back and make a new one.  The manager came over to apologize and offer dessert on the house - very nice touches and not unexpected that there will be some kinks to work out in the kitchen on Day 2.  Handled professionally and we enjoyed the meal and will definitely be back, especially since its so close to home.

Dessert were individual shot glass portions, nost under 250 calories.  The strawberries and cream was light and yummy, and the recommended chocolate covered banana cream pie was a standout.

So, kudos to the waitstaff for knowing the menu and being able to make recommendations, and for being prepared to calmy and efficiently deal with the inevitable growing pains.  The bar area is very nice, actually the decor of the whole place is very nice and inviting. I could definitely see meeting friends here for a drink at the bar and/or dinner or appetizers.

We came a bit early and were told that it was a slow night and we could be seated anytime. We decided to sit up at the bar and have a few drinks (always sit at the bar when visiting places, you'll always get the best stories). The bartender Amelie was a delight and made us several perfectly balanced cocktails. Before we sat down to dinner, Amelie had shared several cocktail recipes with us that we promptly saved in our phones.  

When we were ready for dinner they sat us up near the kitchen, which you can look into while the chefs are working. We ordered the chicken liver pate as an app and I ordered the plum duck breast and my husband ordered the shrimp and grits. Both were outstanding. We didn't even ask our servers (Camille and Cheyenne) for dessert but could see that we were going all out on this meal and brought us two desserts. Two words. Salted caramel. Wow. 

The general manager, Robert so pleasant and accommodating. Top knotch food and service. 

It was really the staff, who went above and beyond to make sure we had a fab meal, that put this over the top for us.

When I first walked in, I noticed that the music was blaring, which seemed to be the reason that people were shouting. This place is EXTREMELY loud! The decor is gorgeous though. I waited in line for about 10 minutes (it was crowded, on a Sunday) and when I got to the register I asked the employee could I order a taro and pineapple smoothie, mixed. She told me that they don't mix flavors. WHAT?! I have never been to a smoothie establishment where they couldn't mix flavors. So, I just decided to order a pineapple smoothie. After waiting for about another 10 minutes, I received my smoothie. The first thing I noticed was the horrific flavor of the ""pineapple"". It's like they used some artificial pineapple flavor and threw hard little pieces of pineapple in the smoothie. It tasted more like pineapple cough syrup. Also, the boba tasted like it was soaked in some kind of weird, disgusting artificial syrup. This was the WORST smoothie I've ever had.

I started the meal with some passion fruit juice and pao de queijo (brazilian cheese bread) which was amazing. I fell in love with passion fruit in the tropics and this juice hit the spot!  Carmo also has a full bar with a wide variety of Latin cocktails that I look forward to trying on my next visit. 

I split ""The Rico"" which is pulled pork topped with avocado, salsa fresca and a tangy sweet  sauce. It is served on a grilled plantain patty topped with melted cheese. There is also a small side salad (with organic greens) and a mango vinaigrette. The pulled pork was filled with flavor and the plantain patty complimented it nicely. 

I also ate ""The Esmerelda"" which is a salad with quinoa, black beans, corn, peppers & cilantro. It has a coconut chili lime vinaigrette, topped with toasted pumpkin seeds & cotija cheese. The Esmerelda had an incredible bold flavor with a lovely little kick. 

Overall, excellent food with great tropical flavors!",2015-01-18 01:06:08,positif,positif

The food was nothing special. The potatoes were taken out before the rest of the food leaving them to look like wrinkly old men feet. 

We were disappointed because semi crunchy breakfast potatoes with eggs were going to give us life this fine vacation morning. But, the egg on the breakfast sandwich lacked the gorgeous runny yolk needed to be the star of the sandwich and combined with the old man potatoes- we were let down.

My $5,000 Waterford crystal chandelier was packed improperly and arrived broken and damaged.  I filed a claim and all they afforded me was $100.  It didn't even come close to paying for the damages.  Lesson learned.  Think twice about anything you hold dear, or is expensive  and would be difficult to replace with this company.  

Also, my driver Tom was fabulous, however my dining room table arrived broken and cracked.  Sierra Moving Systems makes the driver pay for any damages to furniture.  This broke my heart as Tom was incredibly diligent from pickup to delivery.  I suppose that's common practice for moving companies, but it really upset me that a person who was so careful with my things would be financially responsible for something which was completely out of his control.  The day laborer hired to help unload dropped the table, which is what caused the damage.  A large chunk was broken off, and the top was cracked.  What's more, the estimator they sent to my house to assess the damages, lied and said the crack on the top of the table was due to 'weather stress', not moving.  I was pretty irate over that as there was no crack when Tom moved it.  He said as much himself.

Joyce Weaver, the estimator, is great.  She came out to my house twice to ensure she estimated correctly.  This was an expensive move for me (5 figures) and all in all, I'm very happy with the job Sierra Moving Systems provided ... just felt a need to warn anyone who uses their packers or is moving anything of value.",2017-05-25 22:52:04,neutre,négatif

On my first visit, I only ordered the seafood gumbo, their ""File Gumbo"" and I was really happy with that experience. It came with half a crab and a chicken wing! The flavor was good, could have been spicier, but I was generally happy about it. My friends ordered bbq oysters, fried okra and bitesize catfish. They really enjoyed the oysters and catfish but weren't too big fans of the okra, which ended up being lucky for me because I love fried okra and ended up eating the majority of it. 
It's not that it is the best fried okra that I've had but it was definitely super addicting.
The service was a little slow that day, and we were the only people in there, so that was a little weird but maybe because it had pretty much just opened.
I liked this place enough that I brought my other friends here a few days later.
This time, to change things up, I got the starter serving of the catfish etoufee. Guys.... guys.... I liked the gumbo... but I liked this one twice as much! I wasn't super hungry but if I had been I would have definitely gone for the larger ""dinner"" size of it because it was delicious!! My friends tried a bit and really liked it too!
I got another round of fried okra and my friends also liked it. One of my friends got the sausage poboy, and she wasn't a big fan of it. Another friend got the Chowder peas with okra and rice. The pieces of okra were blended rather than whole, but she did enjoy it. It seemed a little plain to me but I was very satisfied with my crawfish etoufee, I highly recommend this dish to anyone who can eat seafood!!

We were seated upstairs and coffee was located downstairs so it took the overburdened server awhile to bring coffee upstairs - who would want coffee in the morning?  The server did not seem to know the menu when asked questions and the brunch menu is very limited?!? One person ordered a biscuit which was served with no accompaniment ie no butter or jam.  She asked for jam & server brought a blueberry dipping sauce which had no taste whatsoeverAND she was charged an additional dollar for it on top of the $4 single biscuit.  All diners were disappointed with the food as it was extremely salty.  The scrambled eggs tasted as if a teaspoon of salt was dumped upon them. The scrambled eggs were not throughly warm.  The biscuits & sausage gravy consisted of 2 biscuits with a small amount of milk gravy and a 2x2"" extremely thin piece of dried out sausage coated in salt. The menu said it was served with a sunny side up egg and when I requested a scrambled egg instead the server said she didn't know if they could do that.  She never got back to us after placing order, but the egg did appear scrambled when served.  We had to request refills on coffee too.  We had $2 mimosas that were okay.

Now...dear reader, in such a dustless hour as clockwork bestoweth itself the loosening of the ties of wirespectacled men and the freeing of the tumbleweed marketplace alongside oneself in this city of St. Louis, Missouri, USA, in the year of our Lord, 2018, the pedestal of the bank shalt closeth and even so, the locked jailcells of the constable, the neon forgetfulness of the 7-11, and the frogginess of all 3A.M. bars are yet once cavalier to the blindness of the collective anonymity of our hunger.  This, too, shalt pass.  But never before the carnival and ceremony herein like some abandoned steamroller gutting away at the hoppinjon of the clay of the river whilst the tide in you too so shall turn.

Now with leaving on a Friday comes with some implication of a fellaship.  The sorta fellaship thou shalt pulse along with yet set onself down.  That aint no sort of white flag pressed up in the wreckage of a ship or a fanned evergreen subject to its own crucifixion past the New Year.  Hunger.  And I mean the real thing.  

My dining companion and I, in such a gunmetalshaden iron horse, found ourselves outside such an establishment in which existed a brooding promise of a fortune that so shall be true, and above all, a good one.  What shall be exactly a fortune, I asked my companion.  Let alone a good one, she said.  A waxen pooling of curiosity in us that a child must feel for the first time upon seeing taxidermy.  

That which is real shalt stay real.  You remember that: That which exists in vaults, catlike, shall stay the same; and that which exists in the freshest of books from the freshest of presses shall not forestall those who nod in their clean, cotton clothes, for they are now are in their own fairgrounds:

Tuckpointed brickery lain by some mason whose hands must have once held the tropics in them at one point for a new world it had felt.  A door and storefront of glass.  Such a miraculous thing yet no yammerin or cardhandlin or pistol hath existeth inside.  And.  Cool air inside.  Can you believe it?  The beads adorning my tresses and leaving a London singsong along my Stetson -- yea, my one and only Stetson, dear reader -- sauntered down their own paned walkway.  In this new world some of the men even had faces absent of hair and such a novel thing no window shall be cherrycolored that the sun may be felt ever so.  Open tables yes like in any respite but we were led to one.  And seated. 

And get this ever so -- clean, potable ice water in a glass not besmudged.  Hallelujah to all the stars that aligneth. 

The saltcod rangoons were tantalizing, though we would have perhaps preferred more provisions with such a fare.  

My drink, with what was called a ""paper plane"" -- have you heard of this, an airplane? some sort of new technology, yet must have began with paper, as all things -- was delicious, albeit, quite small and but a sipworth.  One gullet's sipworth.  

The chicken and this ""tofu"" dish were both extraordinary.  And, in their natural habitat of portion, decentsized.  Larger than some seem to have their quarrel with, for I left a full man.  The chicken had a nice ricochet to it as it danced down my tongue -- the twilight alongside Venetian blinds in the dawn.  

Overall, quite decent, I reckon.  And, again, I can't stress it enough -- eating in a clean, safe place with potable water is a treat in and of itself.  The tasty food was, as I've heard city folk say, ""the icing on the cake.""  Around the Platte banks, we'd call this a 3.375/5, or a ""Kind Midwestern Five,"" with room for growth and innovation yet.

And, admittedly, Chicago-style snobs are second only to New York-style snobs in terms of obnoxious pizza snobbery.

But all in all, I liked my Bazbeaux dinner. We ordered the Luke, which turned out to be an excellent choice. It had a very light amount of red sauce, a blend of cheeses that included bleu cheese, buffalo chicken, red onion, and small pieces of celery that I could've done without. I then proceeded to smother the thing in bleu cheese dressing to create a spicy, tangy CHEESY EXPLOSION IN MY MOUTH.

The food here is outstanding! My husband tried the Gumbo for an appetizer. This was the first time we had ever tried alligator and it was outstanding. Who knew that the meat of an alligator is tender and mouth watering. I would definitely recommend this dish, especially if you have never tried it. 

We had a garden salad, that was not just your average garden salad, with candied pecans and house made farmer's cheese it was a note worthy choice on the menu.

I had a the Double-Cut Tomahawk Pork Chop. I can hands down say that this is the best pork chop I have ever had in my life. I would live in that pork chop if I could! It had the perfect sweet and savory caramelization on the outside.I will be dreaming of that dish for a good long time. 

For dessert, we shared the Cafe Au Lait Creme Brûlée with Calas and dark chocolate covered coffee beans! It was amazing. The coffee flavor was sleek and soothing to the palate. I couldn't get enough of this flavor. I savored every bite.

I have a unit that faces the outside of the building on the south side and the noise level from the street traffic can be horrible at most times of the day/night, to the point that I've had to start playing white noise and wearing ear plugs whenever I'm at home. The units are EXTREMELY close to the back road that connects to the parking garage, so all 450 people who live here are driving by my window at all hours of the day and night entering and exiting the garage. The back street also acts as a cut-through during rush hour for commuters trying to avoid Boy Scout Blvd. From 7 AM to about 10-11 PM, the noise spills into my bedroom and living room and makes it hard to relax or focus on anything, or even sleep for that matter. Over time this has really taken a toll on my quality of life, since I came in here expecting a somewhat quiet and peaceful living experience, and gotten exactly the opposite.

Other than the traffic noise, I really don't have any complaints about Modera. The building is made of concrete throughout the floors and walls, not wood. The units are very nice with quality fixtures, granite countertops, faux wood linoleum floors, washer/dryer, the works. The gym is probably the nicest apartment gym I've ever seen, and the pool area is also very well-done. The ladies in the front office have been overwhelmingly kind and helpful during my entire stay here. I've never had a complaint about any of them. There are a lot of apartments in this area that pretend to be ""high-end"" and it truly feels like Modera is ""actually"" high-end.

It's not even the menu items really; there are just simply too many pictures and (dare I say it) too many items to choose from! I've tried some of the new options, and each time I try something new, I've been disappointed. And admittedly, if I was going to overhaul something about the restaurant, I would take a real good look at the decor. The entrance/bar area is very dark and gives off a dungeon vibe.

I find myself opting for take out rather than wanting to go into the restaurant for dinner. In my experience, this is never a good sign. Over time I feel like I'm losing interest. But in a pinch, when I get a sushi craving, I do remember to call in.",2014-07-26 09:01:46,neutre,positif

Which is why I guess I continue to go. However being the best compared to terrible gyms doesn't make it amazing. At first I was obsessed. But lately it has been so crowded it's hard to deal with. I used to love working out in the mornings getting ready at the gym then going to work. That's the reason I joined such an expensive gym, was to have a nice locker room. However, if I do that there's no where to get ready. I wait to find a spot to put on makeup and try to blow dry my hair. It's way too crowded for only about 10 stations to get ready at. Also the classes are super crowded. If you don't book it right away you can't get into any of the good ones. It's been so frustrating. 

And on top of it they change their perks without explaining. When I joined a perk was free PSN sports teams. It's one of the reasons I was ok with the price. I join and email about how it works and I'm told ""they no longer do that"" without any explanation. I emailed back to ask why and when this occurred because it's one of the reasons I joined and no one has responded to me ever. It's been over a month. 

It's the best of what's around but I don't think it's worth the cost. To top off all of my issues I just received a letter they're raising the monthly fee. It's only by a few dollars but it's the principal. So frustrated but unfortunately in philly there's no where else to go. So that's why it's so popular. The best of what's around by far as far as facilities, etc. but they make it hard to enjoy sometimes.",2016-01-16 02:41:12,neutre,neutre

First of all, the service was wonderful. My parents seemed to know everyone in the place, but since we live so close we've been eating at every resturant that's been in the space over the past 30 years. I have romantic memories of the Blue Ram where my mom used to work and I was allowed to pour my own sodas at the bar. I liked Lions Heart Pub and their awesome burgers. Now, there are some inconsistencies I have to warn you about: 

First we got two wobbly tables. Wobblys! Noo! Luckily the place was not crowded so we made it to a non-wobbly table. 

I was feeling special so I ordered the filet mignon. I don't know what I was expecting for a 10oz steak, but it seemed huge! It was cooked perfectly medium. Seasoned just right. With a nice side of yellow squash and zucchini. The other side though...

Now, the potatoes. My family disagreed about the potatoes, they thought it was a lovely low-carb presentation. In Washington state we would refer to these as jo-jos, and there were only two of them. TWO. If you don't know what a jo-jo is, it's like a double steak fry. People, potatoes are cheap, and I know I don't really need a whole baked potato with my steak, but you just gave me a quarter of a potato. Potatoes are NOT a garnish. If you are going to serve me potatoes, no matter how you serve them, give me at least one whole potato and let ME decide how much i want to eat.  

Now, I grew up very close to here and have been frequenting every resturant at this location. Plan B though, has a little work to do, but since it's in the neighborhood I'll definitely be going back.",2010-02-01 15:53:05,neutre,positif

Enter Reno Running Company!

The store is laid out nicely with 2 treadmills (I'll get to that in a sec) in the front and men's and women's clothing on both sides with the shoes in the back.  I was greeted by Nicole who told me that we could do an analysis of my walk to find the right shoe.  Yes!  Let's do that!

After measuring my feet, she put me in a pair of shoes and off to the treadmill we went. It's a good thing I was in my workout clothes still.  She put the speed where I normally would be at the gym and I proceeded to walk for a few minutes.  After that, we watched a video of my walk.  Turns out, I don't have any issues as far as leaning one way or the other.  I'm pretty straight on, so I didn't have to worry about adding any extra support or anything.  What Nicole did figure out though, was that I needed a shoe with a wider toe area and my Nikes do not have that.  I asked her what was on sale (holy crap, quality shoes can be pricy!) and she grabbed 6 different pair of sale shoes for me.  

My feet fell in love with the New Balance brand which were on sale from $140 to $88.  SCORE!

LhNNeD8k1_bNA4a1wdwZSQ,VVNj3hSE8drWCu8xUXH05Q,TfcpJBiFNnDaochnmp4M2Q,5,4,5,4,"I had not heard about this local establishment until I discovered it on Yelp doing a search near where my little sister from Big Brothers Big Sisters lives as I was picking her up and taking her out for brunch yesterday. I had decided to check the place out based on the good reviews, and it did not disappoint. There was a significant wait, as was expected, but that's pretty much the norm for any quality brunch spot in town. And I want to make sure to mention now before I go on below about my experience regarding the owners and customer service. The owners take pride in their food and customer service and it showed.

My little sister (a senior in high school) and I arrived about 10:30 on a Sunday morning. There is a very tight parking lot behind the house, and I was lucky a spot was hidden in there because I had 7 month old son with me and I didn't have to carry him far or pull out the stroller. The place was packed and we were quoted an hour wait. It was beautiful outside and they have a large deck with wrap around seating and other chairs so most people were able to sit and wait. It was a beautiful and sunny 60+ degree day in February, so we didn't mind hanging out and enjoying the sun.

We were seated after about a 45 minute wait. Since I had reviewed their website and menu prior to coming, I knew that it was their owner, Jennifer, who took our drink order, then our food order. The food appeared to be a little slow to come out, as the patrons next to us who ordered right before us got their food after about 20 minutes or so after placing their order. This was not an issue as I know they were busy and make your food to order. So then I was expecting our food shortly after. But as time kept ticking away, I noticed table after table (about 4) get their food with no sign of ours. And since I was sitting by the entrance, these were tables that were being seated long after we placed our order getting their food. Since this was at least another 15-20 minutes later, I got up and asked the host if someone could just check on our order. I was not complaining, it was just at this point thinking our order got lost or ended up with someone else. Plus, I've been entertaining a 7 month old for a while now! So after about a minute, Jennifer came over to our table and seemed shocked that we had not received our food, and told us the entire meal was on them. I tried to explain that wasn't necessary that I just wanted to eat before my son decided he was too bored or hungry, but she ran back to the kitchen before I could. Our food came out within a few minutes and she apologized again.

Now, onto the food. I got the bananas fosters pancakes. I love anything bananas fosters, and these were delicious. Three fluffy pancakes were covered in sauteed bananas, walnuts, and that yummy warm buttery brown sugar rum sauce (and whipped cream). They were served with a side of meat of your choice and two eggs cooked to choice. They only offer turkey meat products, no pork. I got the turkey sausage since they make it in house, and it was very good. I got my eggs over medium, and they were slightly overcooked to about medium well with some of the yolk being hard, but that was not an issue. My little sister ordered just a plate of eggs, meat, and toast, but they allowed her to substitute a fruit cup for the eggs as she does not like eggs. Overall the food was delicious with multiple menu items I'd love to come back and try, from omelets to eggs benedict to other specialty pancakes and French toast options.  

They also have delicious fruit tea and a variety of drink options. I didn't know when I ordered but they don't offer free refills on their fruit tea, but Jennifer gladly refilled me with regular tea instead.

Luckily for me I happened to have cash this day to leave a nice tip for them since they did comp the entire meal for us. They obviously care about their guests and the quality of food, and I will definitely return with my husband or bring my parents when they come into town, especially since they don't eat pork and it's sometimes difficulty to find breakfast/brunch places that offer turkey options.",2016-02-29 15:36:08,positif,négatif

It is the perfect little brunch spot in University City (they have another location in Center City, but I've never been there). My boyfriend lives really close so we stop here pretty often to grab a bite to eat. The food has always been fantastic and we love that they have new specials so often and how personalized the chef makes them!

Some rules:

1. If you like french toast, you have to try the Stuffed Challah French Toast. It is to die for and I don't say that lightly. It is just that stinking good. The portion is HUGE (it's really enough for two people) and I always wind up bringing some of it home. I like ordering it with a side of sausage and turning it into 2-3 meals. The stuffing is sweet with just a hint of sour to make it jive really well with the vanilla bean sauce. (Can you tell I'm a fan?!)

2. Don't be afraid to try the specials! My boyfriend almost always orders something off of the special menu and its easy to do - they change them frequently enough that you truly do have a limited amount of time to try them.

3. If you want a more relaxed experience, avoid peak meal times. The place is hoppin' and if you go around a normal meal time you may find yourself waiting quite a while, or crowded into a small table because that is all that they have available. We like to go for more of a brunch time and there is usually much less of a crowd. We rarely go on the weekends because it is just packed.

We stayed in a deluxe room on the second floor of the main building.  Our room had a full kitchen, dining set, fridge/freezer, and microwave.  We were happy with everything at the Eagle Inn.  When we arrived, we noticed how clean the room was.  

Overall, Santa Barbara hotel prices are high, but the Eagle Inn was reasonable.  Other hotels in the same area charged more, but looked older.
   
The location is two blocks from the beach in a quiet residential area.  It was a 10 minute walk to the wharf, and about 15 minutes walking to downtown.  The hotel has a private parking lot.  The lot was full in the evenings, but we were always able to find a parking spot.

The customer service was great.  The front desk was very efficient during both check-in and check-out.  All the employees were professional and friendly.

They have cookies and iced tea in the afternoon during check-in.  There is a library of DVDs that you can borrow from.  The free WIFI was nice.  The hot continental breakfast in the morning was good.  Each morning we got a bowl of fresh fruit, followed by either bagels and lox, yogurt with granola, or a hash brown bake with english muffin.  My favorite was the hash brown bake.

My wife was very happy with the Eagle Inn.  We enjoyed our stay and plan to return the next time we visit Santa Barbara.",2011-09-12 18:55:40,positif,positif

DO NOT FALL FOR ""KOBE BEEF"".  It is not at all what you would expect from anything you have ever heard about ""kobe beef"".

Price: 13.99 for regular week days.  More expansive on the weekends.

I am a long time Harrahs goer.  As a matter of fact, I only gamble at Harrahs when I am in Reno.  Carving buffet is the one that I used to always go to.  Aside from crappy comp points nowadays, Harrah's buffet has also really disappointed me in the past 2 trips.

Their selection is actually ok, they have less buffet counter than many other casinos, but other places repeat their selections over and over to fill up the counter.  King crab legs are just as salty as everyone else's.  Snow crab legs are kind of small, but acceptable.

Now prime ribs: MAN! How can you mess up prime ribs?  For the past two trips, both time they have only had well done prime ribs.  Yes well done though out! The whole thing! There were not ""middle part that are more red"", it is just one big chunk of fire log like thing that they somehow call ""prime rib"".  

An Asian chef was manning the carving station.  I waited for an hour and half, for that ""next one"" to come, only to see more completely well done prime ribs, and there were nothing the chef was willing to do to solve the problem.  Perhaps it was not his fault that he didn't understand what I was saying, but come on! It is called ""carving buffet"", so what about having an English speaking chef that knows how to cook prime ribs to man the ""carving station""?  Would it be the least the buffet can do to keep up its name? 

And the Kobe beef they had, as advertise in front of the buffet.  It is nothing but a big chunk of beef shoulder roast.  It had nothing to do with the tender, melt in your mouth legendary Kobe Beef, just a big tough chuck of roasted beef.  I felt so scammed when I ate that thing, even though I somehow knew I shouldn't be expecting high grade Kobe beef with perfect marble distribution that melts in your mouth.  Still I have no idea why and how dare they call it Kobe beef.  I would have asked if the Asian chef understood English.

The good thing is that they had ""cook to order"" New York steaks.  And the lady was very nice and cooked everything according to my needs.  This earned them an extra star, along with my personal year of good memory I had with Harrah's Casino in the past.",2007-08-07 23:47:55,négatif,neutre

First of all, the salon is beautiful, high end establishment.  The employees there have a tendency to take themselves a little too seriously, thinking that being aloof is synonoymous for upscale.  A smile and acknowlegment would be nice.  The line of hair products, Oribe to mention one, is fantastic.  I am a fan.  What I am not a fan of is that I feel, due to my demographic group, I was somewhat dismissed.

One appointment I waited over 30 minutes before the stylist came out and saw I was there.  I did, on several occassions try to catch the eye of the two receptionists behind the counter to no avail.  Also, I felt hurried through.  Even though highlights took forever (which is fine) the shampoo, base bump, and styling were rush.  Extra add-ons were put on my bill that I did not authorize, such as a Kerataise treatment for $30.00.  I still do not know when that took place unless it is similiar to a minute conditioner.

My bill on average was $200+, not including the tip.  The color was fantastic, the cut varied and it was never styled to my satisfaction with most of the time leaving the salon with it slightly damp.  My take is that their market is for the professional 20-30 age group.  While I am mildly satisfied, it is not worth the time (3 hours round trip), gasoline and expense.

I already had a diamond (family heirloom), so I was just looking for a setting. I had initially started my ring search at one of the larger chains (through a family recommendation), but then relocated to Jeweler's Row. I was very unfamiliar with the jewelers in that area, so I turned to Yelp for guidance and in doing so, found John's shop through all of the incredible reviews he had received.

The first time I walked into his shop, he was helping another couple design a custom setting. He gave me his card and asked me to return, but encouraged me to check out other shops in the area, which was surprisingly honest of him. He was so awesome to work with. I already had a pretty good idea of what my fiance wanted, and John helped bring it to reality. He never tried to push me one way or another, gave me plenty of time to come to a decision (3 visits before I gave him a deposit), and was just so nice and helpful (and knowledgeable) the entire time.

The ring itself was beautiful, and exactly what my fiance wanted. Also, it was incredibly affordable. It was a little too big (apparently I had the wrong ring size), but a week after I proposed, my fiance brought it to John and he resized it the same day. It now fits perfectly.

I knew that once I went, I would never be the same. And I was right. I have actually already applied for a job there. I need to be in this space with these magical creatures. 

I was walking by just as it opened and thought this was as good a time as any to stop the madness. My first impression was how clean and organized everything was. The cafe area was top notch and cozy, with cat paraphernalia galore. There are yummy snacks to nosh on and the drinks are no joke. There is quality coffee (I had a Caramel Macchiato), designer tea (I had a chai latte), and even smoothies (I LOVED the mango). They even bother to make little designs in the foam...I had a flower and a cat paw of cinnamon. Very clever touch. The drinks are unlimited so bottoms up! Some people may scoff at the $15 price tag for an hour with the cats, but it's pretty much free it if you have three $5 drinks. 

The real danger here are the cats. You will be hard pressed not to adopt one. I am not joking. I almost walked out with Penny, the little white one with yellow eyes who stole my heart. I almost cried when I had to leave her. If you have a little kid, good luck with getting out without a new pet. Don't go here unless you are looking to adopt a cat or risk the wrath of your child.

These cats are seriously adorable and in every personality. They are some of the most well behaved and lovable felines I have met. They are fine with kids, even the little ones who can be less than gentle. They are active and playful and mostly polite. Sometimes they even fetch their toys and bring them to you to play. It's darling!

I love that there is an area for small children and one that is for only 7 years and up. I was pleasantly surprised that the kittens bounded right down there with the children to play with them. These are not scaredy cats at all which means they are probably going to make wonderful forever pets. 

I love that the cafe has already adopted out over 100 cats since they opened a year ago. This place is really doing our community a service by supporting SAFE team which is a no kill organization aimed at educating the public and saving animals lives.

I am a big fan of Commanders Palace and have eaten there over 20 times with not one disappointment.  We went there the night before and decided that we would try another place.  I had read great reviews about Restaurant August and planned to go there for my 50th wedding anniversary.  What a disaster.  The food was inedible.  I ordered lamb only to find out it was done in vinegar.  It was terrible.  Not to be outdone my wife ordered octopus and it was also done with some type of vinegar sauce.  My daughter who is also an excellent cook was extremely disappointed with her fish dish.  The portions are small and I don't have a problem with that but the three of us did not finish our meals.

Listen I know that most of the world can't deliver food the way that St. Barts does.
To me one of the key things of having a good restaurant is to have good recipes.  I have never cooked or served either lamb or octopus in a vinegar sauce.  

To top it off we had a waitress who was trying to be the next Bob Hope; she very annoying and had inappropriate comments throughout the evening.  For example when my wife and daughter
went to the rest room the waitress come buy to tell myself and the gentlemen with me that we shouldn't steal the desserts from the women when they were away from the table.

The desserts,however, were A+ and the ambiance of the room was magnificent.  The gentlemen who was overseeing the dining room was outstanding and a gentlemen.

My girlfriend and I had our first meal there at 5 pm yesterday, and loved it. We ordered 4 dishes, a total of about $33($40 with a tip), and had a little trouble finishing everything and licking the plates. ""I could eat 2 green papaya salads myself"" was my thought.
The large chicken pho came piping hot with a bunch of mung bean sprouts, a bouquet of basil and 1/2 a lime on the side. Next time, I'd get even more sprouts. So good. 
The Shrimp Summer Rolls and sweet peanut dressing were delicious.  The Broken Rice/Chargrilled Pork looked like it would be our least favorite but was incredibly tasty. My friend who'd live in Thailand near the Vietnam border thought the rice was cooked perfectly.

The new menu is pretty good, and I like that the sandwiches come with a side salad (which is really good--no iceberg lettuce here!) instead of chips. Nothing that knocks me off my feet, but it's not bad if you're there all evening to study.

Instead of hanging a speaker on the side of the car, you can tune into a dedicated AM station.  Just make sure your speakers are working in your car.
 The concession stand is kind of ghetto, in my opinion. There's the fake cheese, nachos, popcorn, and hot dogs, all a little overpriced, but you fell like you're walking in a grade school cafeteria line.
 Stereotypically, drive-ins are make out spots, and it's kind of funny to smirk at ""steamed up windows."" I didn't know that happened, but it does here.

I ate all the chili and hot dogs I desired - wait for it .......... for free. I won an autographed football during a raffle, embarrassed myself upon receiving it by incorrectly identifying the Hall of Famer whose signature adorned the ball, and promptly sold the ball before exiting to pay for my bar tab (free food and free beverage - what a time). And most importantly, I witnessed, for the first time in my life, an of-age patron order an O'Doul's. Amazing. 

So, when it came time for this year's clash of the titans, I knew exactly where to go. With an even larger group, I returned for the Super Bowl, 2009 edition, to find that, even in our crumbling economy, free hot dogs and chili were still to be had. A few buckets of beer and my very first taste of wings later, wouldn't you know it, I won yet another raffle. I'm also pretty sure that I fell in love with the tall, blonde waitress in the skintight referee's uniform, but alas, it was fleeting. 

Yes, my experiences were grand. But really, this is a pretty average place. There are plenty of TVs for athletic event-watching, but one is always a couple of seconds ahead of all the others and the sound. A bucket of A-B products and a 2 lb. plate of wings that seems to vary in size from table to table will run you $20, so take that for what it's worth. And truth be told, one does end up paying for the free food in the end. But this really is a hidden gem for events such as the Super Bowl. The staff seems to work hard to keep the atmosphere light and the fun flowing. 

So, will I return? Every Super Bowl that I am still in St. Louis for. And I suggest you all do the same.",2009-02-14 05:45:48,neutre,positif

I went to both Clearwater and St Pete/Pass-A-Grille beaches while in Florida and found both to be quite similar. The beaches are wide though if you're going during low tide more than half the beach is moist and packed down and you'll be farther from the calm clear waters if you want to sit in the soft white sand. Everyone talks about how white the sand is at Siesta Key and although it is the whitest sand, the sand at the rest of the beaches in the area don't vary a great deal and are still very nice. St Pete beach is a longer beach and if you keep going south you'll reach Pass-A-Grill which is much less busy (it's mostly residential) but there's still a nice concentration of restaurants/shops on 8th ave (otherwise the shops at St Pete can be spread out a bit). Clearwater's slightly smaller beach makes for a little denser business concentration and they do have pier 60 which is cool to check out or go fishing on (for a small fee). If you're debating between the two there really isn't a huge difference. There are nice beach bars at both, same great sunset, same great soft sand, and you have to pay for parking and leave your alcohol at home (or of course get creative with it). If I had to choose between the two I'd give the edge to Clearwater as it has transportation to Tampa, better nearby restaurants, and has a little bit more going on (if you wanted seclusion you wouldn't really be going to either beach anyway).",2011-10-26 03:25:55,positif,positif

Here's the latest. Over two months ago, the control board on my washer went out.
I was told that it would be delivered to my door on November 30. 
It never came. When I called to unload on them, dropping more F bombs than a person should, the exasperated girl on the other line informed me that they had a policy that I could get reimbursed for the money I've spent at launder mats.
She gave me the number and I filed a claim. They told me that they did not know when they would be receiving the control panel for my washer... they didn't anticipate it any time soon.
I decided to hire an independent contractor and just get the job done.
He researched the part, and found that the part was made by whirlpool and was on backorder until 2020. That's correct- 6 years from now.
We've gotten nothing but dishonest, sub par dealings from these idiots.

My friends and I came for a Saturday brunch, and despite being told that the wait would be 30-35 minutes, we were seated within 10. Apparently, no one hangs out waiting for their name to be called. The diner is spacious inside, with much more room between tables than at any of their Santa Barbara locations. If you're coming with a large party or have a medical condition that requires more accessibility, this would be the best Cajun Kitchen to go to.

The menu is the same as the rest of the franchise, but the specials and sweet drinks at the coffee bar set it aside from the rest. Don't like your coffee black or basic cafe items? Try an ultra sweet caramel latte instead. The specials here when we were there included an andouille sausage benedict and a grilled turkey sandwich, which didn't sound particularly special. We went for Kitch classics instead: the tri tip benedict, two chicken fried steaks with cornbread, scrambled eggs, and home fries, and fried chicken and waffles.

The quality here is very consistent -- I like that they use drumsticks and wing pieces for the fried chicken, personally, because the dark meat is delicious. Everything came piping hot and revitalized even the sleepiest of our table that Saturday morning. And, because it's the wonderful diner it is, everything was diner priced -- we each made it out of there having spent less than $20, including tip.

I had seen the same dentist for 23 years and when he retired, I didn't really know where I should go. After putting it off for nearly 2 years, I decided to make an appointment (the fact that I KNOW I needed a rootcanal didn't help with my promptness!) with Dr. Sukoneck and Wilson. Immediately upon arriving, the receptionist (Reese) made me feel so welcomed and comfortable. The dental hygienist, MaryAnn, also very sweet, made me feel even more comfortable than I did before. She also used this amazing new tool on me which polishes off any stains on your teeth (coffee, wine, etc...) Next, I had to see Dr. Sukoneck. It was very obvious I was in dire need of a rootcanal, which ironically began KILLING me the night prior to my appointment. Dr. Sukoneck had plans to leave the office early and when he heard how much pain I was in, put off his plans to leave early and immediately began to drill out the painful root (Step 1 of a rootcanal) so I wouldn't be in so much pain. I would recommend this dentist to anyone. They are so great.One thing I really appreciated about this office was that with each mention of bad news, they follow it up with some good news. For example, although I had neglected the fact I needed a rootcanal for some time, they made me aware that I had been taking really good care of my teeth overall and there was hardly any plaque buildup. It may not seem like  a big deal, but for how nervous I was, it really helped to put me at ease. I actually wish there were more than 5 stars, because this office deserves more than just 5. They will work with you on payments, they are not eager for the money like other offices I have visited, they honestly just want people to be free of any tooth discomfort and happy with their smiles.

Tucked away in the garden district, the Commander's Place is an example of what fine dining should be. Refined yet quirky. My fiancée and I came here to celebrate her 30th birthday 4 months after the fact with a dinner in style.

First impressions,
Exterior. I would have never guessed that this was the famed commander's palace. It looked more like something I would expect to see on the Santa Monica Pier or Coney Island, but once inside, I was instantly immersed into a realm that reminded me of a Ladurée in Paris meets the Blue Bayou.  Beautifully decorated we were greeted at the entrance with a man and a woman who received our reservations and showed us to our table. We were asked if there was an occasion for being here, we answered.
Soon after being seated our back up waitress came by and asked my fiancée if she cared to celebrate with some balloons. ""Balloons?"" she expressed, ""Balloons!"" was the reply! ""Yes!"" was the answer, 3 Balloons to our table did fly!  We were given the wine list with an explanation as to how to navigate through it.

Our Head waiter came to our table and instantly recognized our accents. 
-""Southern California?""  
-""How did you know?""
-""Call it a hunch, I'm from up North""
-""Ah""
-**Nods**

I think he sensed that my fiancée was nervous in this place, and not really knowing how to act, so he was trying to break the ice and make us ALL feel at ease. 

We ordered... wow. we ordered a delicious I think 8 course meal with wine pairings. No Regrets

But there was a problem. We didn't have the famed Turtle soup on our menu!!! So we asked if we could have a taste. Our waiter with a smile and a raised eyebrow, said ""I'll see what I can do to get y'all a taste"" (yes one quickly falls into the ""y'all"" thing here, everyone says it and it's so natural!) ""I think we should bring it out as your first course, Yes... I think that will fit in just right""

Next thing you know we were blissfully escorted to a realm where our mouths couldn't get enough of anything. EVERYTHING was delicious! And the wine flights! wow no kidding! Descriptions of what was from where and what to look out for in the flavors made this a culinary experience. I frankly won't do anything any justice by explaining the foods to you, you'll have to discover those yourselves. Suffice it to say however we were STUFFED and happy.... And a bit tipsy.

And despite the fact that we were the last diners in the place our servers did not skimp a touch on the service, indicating to us that we were not to rush and that it's their pleasure to have us. (our reservation was a little late and the place closes relatively early, so do watch out for that!!!)

Ultimately when we got our bill we noticed that we weren't even charged for the turtle soup. When I indicated this to the waiter, he said:
-""You're our guest, we're glad you enjoyed it!""

We were offered a taxi to take our smiling faces back to our hotel!


Thank you Commander's Palace for a truly memorable evening!",2016-08-22 22:11:13,positif,positif

My father in law lives around the corner from 1010, and we got take out from there tonight which we hadn't before with FIL. I have a lot of food restrictions so eating out at new places, especially pizza, can be difficult. I ordered a salad and asked for it to be made without croutons, onions, and olives and added tuna to it. 

I was so impressed at how every detail was done as I asked, at the portion of mine, my spouses and their dads, and how good it all was. The amount of tuna I got was enough to last me a few days. I'm also really picky with French fries and theirs were made to perfection and the portion once again was incredible.

My husband and I ordered an appetizer and entrees. We had the chicken strips app, lobster cakes and a steak. Nothing was seasoned!

The lobster cakes were supposed to be a lump cake but there was so much filler in them and they tasted like nothing. The entrees came with risotto which was hard and gluey again with no taste. Literally like you were eating paste. The steak was well cooked but again no flavor. The waitress must have known how bad the food was because as soon as our dishes were served she walked over and asked how everything was before we could even try it and then disappeared. 

We never had a chance to even tell her about the awful meal until the very end because she was no where to be found. She was apologetic and said that they have been having a lot of complaints lately because of a new chef.

I had an idea of what I wanted as far as highlights went, but I wasn't exactly sure how to articulate it.  I showed Kyle a few pictures and after a brief chat about my color history and confirming my ""vision"", she was off to mix up my color!

I really appreciated her attention to detail and the amount of time she spent checking my color to make sure it was the perfect shade.  She also gave me a great trim and a head full of waves to send me on my way.  I am so happy with the results and have gotten many compliments!

Everyone else at the salon was also very accommodating and friendly.

She recommended Katie's Pizza and Pasta, because it is a convenient location and it had an extensive menu. I had asked for a good seat and something special for our birthday celebration. Our waitress, Chelsea brought a mini bottle of Prosecco to the table as we were seated and the hostess honored my request from Open Table, seating us near the windows. My friend said the patio seating is wonderful in good weather and that they give young children pizza dough to play with to occupy them before the food arrives.

We were given complimentary Italian white bean dip with warm pizza dough like pita. It was excellent and flavorful. We ordered an appetizer, pizza, pasta and shared: the fried artichoke appetizer, the arugula dyed long spiral pasta with cream sauce and mushrooms and the pear pizza. Every item was unique, had distinct flavors, was fresh and delicious. The pear pizza was a light contrast to the rich but not heavy pizza. The mushrooms were sautéed in a truffle oil and were something I'd try to recreate. 

You can see them making the fresh pasta and it's amazing. I loved the lightness of the flash fried artichoke with the creamy dipping sauce and balsamic glaze. The pizza was almost like a savory galette tart. There were flavors of honey and some nice salty contrast of the prosciutto. It was beautifully made. Usually I'm a strictly red pizza devotee, but the pear pizza was unique and definitely a pizza I'd order again. 

The prices, including two generous pours of glasses of wine, were really reasonable for the quality and service. I live in the DC area where this meal would be twice the price. The salads and appetizers are higher for St. Louis, but not stifling. 
My friend said they have a great happy hour (3-6) and are a good place to have a nice meal with your kids.

We didn't know what to expect because of the mixed reviews we'd read, and after discussing what we would write about it on Yelp, I really hesitate to give this place more than two stars. 

Although the decor is quite nice and the wait staff seemed personable (our waitress was lovely), we were really disappointed in the quality of food and felt it was extremely overpriced for what it was. The wine list is decent, but again, too expensive for the quality. We started with the fennel, pear and almond soup which was actually quite good; unfortunately, the entrees were not. There are no vegetarian options at all (I knew this beforehand, but hey, free meal!), so I opted for the crab cakes. I really don't know how you can screw up crab cakes, but these were terrible. They were completely flavorless and I had to douse them with several lemon wedges to get any taste at all. The cakes weren't even properly breaded and were coated in this strange, thin, non-bread crust... it was odd. They were served with a very bland hollandaise sauce and some steamed spinach. I was very disappointed at the weak effort and high price ($27!) and have definitely made better ones at home for much less. Overall, a very boring dish. 

My sister ordered the special filet mignon, and was not thrilled about it. It was served with mashed potatoes and green beans. Although the steak was cooked perfectly and was very tender, she complained that the dish was very salty, and not worth the price. Again, we feel we could've had better if we'd made it at home. For dessert we split a creme brulee, which was decent, but nothing to scream about.  I really wouldn't recommend coming here unless you are heartset on overpaying for an uncreative, tasteless meal.",2010-12-16 13:41:06,négatif,négatif

She is the nurse practitioner that I see at this office. She has been very helpful the past few years and I never feel uncomfortable or that she's judging me when I am talking to her. My biggest issue is the wait time. I dread going for an appointment. I always wait at least 45 minutes in the waiting room, then I have to wait another half hour in the exam room before I am seen. This is absolutely ridiculous. I usually have to make my appointments for the evening because I am working during the day so when I go, I know that I'll most likely be spending my whole night at the doctors. Most of the staff is pretty professional and nice, I can't complain. I have had a few very negative experiences with very unprofessional young girls behind the desk. I vocalized my concern for one very negative experience I had because I was so upset and pissed off that this happened to me. I am most likely going to change offices, however.

My entire experience at MT (from walking up to the building, to ordering to eating outside) reminded me of Austin. I don't know if the owners are from there, but it's definitely the vibe I got. This isn't a bad thing. Rather than the most authentic Mexican food experience possible, I think Mas Tacos serves up some very yummy Mex-texish (my word) fare that's decidedly more 'blue dot and weird' than anything else the Lone Star state has to offer. Add in a healthy dollop of 'San Diego' for good measure.

Be warned: you will order more than you can eat. Everything sounds so good and is (relatively) fairly-priced, you're going to be tempted to order a ton. Take it from someone who ordered way too much: plan your order and then order one thing less. Your stomach will thank you. I started with the watermelon-lime agua fresca. Whatever you do, avail yourself of agua fresca. Whenever it's on a menu, I order it. MT's didn't disappoint. Packed with flavor but light and refreshing for a late summer day, I could have consumed gallons of the stuff. It's a good thing I didn't, because I ate way too much as it was.

I started with the chicken tortilla soup. Far from what you might remember from a popular fast(er) food chain (which, if I'm being honest, has decent soup for what it is), this is without-a-doubt homemade and magically delicious. You'll want to drink the broth. The soup is filled with tortilla, cheese, cilantro, tomato, corn, and shredded chicken. The avocado which topped by soup and filled the bowl was a welcome addition. I found the soup a touch lime-y but I like citrus. If your taste isn't accustomed to tartness, ask for a sample before diving in. For the main event, I ordered the fish tacos. Freaking awesome. HUGE pieces of tilapia, surrounded by onion, cabbage and dill. Perfect. My mistake came in ordering three of them. I was expecting the small, wimpy fish tacos you can get at other places. Not so here. These tacos are substantial. Order wisely. The only bummer of the meal came from the eating environment. Since the day was nice, we ate outside... and were swarmed by flies. They were everywhere. It made eating tough and not the least bit appetizing. Granted, it's getting colder now but in the future, I'll make sure my MT meals are conducted inside.",2014-10-22 14:42:13,positif,positif

It was very busy but not unpleasantly packed.The cocktail menu is amazing. Their menu is pasted into pages of old children's books.The one I got was ""What Is a Stranger and What Should I Do?"" which was wonderfully creepy.  My bartender Kate was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.She started me with ""The Hemingway"" rum cocktail-it was sweet and refreshing. Because so many of the drinks sounded tantalizing on the menu I decided to switch it up to the ""Branch Cosmo"" for my next drink.It was such a refreshing change from the saccharine sweet that you have come to expect from your typical cosmo.Fresh cranberries and orange were muddled into the Tito's vodka.It was delicious.Both the Hemingway and the Cosmo were made with all fresh ingredients and were both balanced and stiff. They tasted the way a beautiful spring day feels.

There was a shift change and Brendon took over on bartending duties.I noticed it was still happy hour so I figured I would take advantage of the specials and order an Old Fashioned.It was easily the best Old Fashioned I had ever had in my life. I can definitely see myself going back to Bourbon & Branch for many many more of these.

The cocktail prices might have seemed a little expensive at first glance but they were all WELL worth the price.

By this time I realized I was pretty hungry so I decided to order some food.
The Irish nachos appetizer was awesome and more than affordably priced.It was ample enough for 3-4 people to eat. Since it was just me,there were PLENTY of leftovers.

They offered to make it a meal for $5, with hash browns and a orange juice and have it delivered. They called me back 4 times to ask what my order was... OK  they came 45 minutes later. the food was cold the meat was overcooked and of poor quality, they used old horrible bread and they onions were raw and they forgot the ketchup....

Unless of course you were a hot girl shaking your booty in the creepy DJ's face.  Those girls were able to get up multiple times.

Smoked old fashioned was the highlight of the night in taste and uniqueness. Guacamole was great but the chips were a little not crispy, but still edible.  Both the old fashioned and the Guac were equally expensive at 10.25 for the Guac and 11 for the drink.  I wanted to try both and enjoyed them, but next time I may skip it and go for a beer instead.

Our group of friends had a variety of just about the key things on the menu.  I had the Skirt steak, my wife had the fish tacos, others at our table had the chorizo burger and we finished everything off with a four way split of a cuban sandwich.

My skirt steak was OK, the beef came out cold in the middle, but I think it was because it may have sat while other orders were getting prepared.  Loved the mini carrots on the side and the beans and rice were also OK but needed a little more flavor.  

Cuban sandwich was on point (except it didn't have any salami...) and they used real cuban bread from La Sagunda in Tampa.  The ham was great and the pernil/pork was also very good.  All the key ingredients for a great pressed Cuban.   

Service was also very good however it did take a while to get our orders out.  I suspect this is because the restaurant has been open less than a week and they are probably still working the kinks out.

Outdoor seating was plentiful, indoor seating looked pretty limited to the bar and a few tables inside a small house-turned-restaurant, but don't be afraid to sit outside.  We were quite comfortable with the many fans they have scattered on the ceiling.  

Overall, we were pretty happy but not 4 and 5 star happy.  I'll give it a few more weeks to work out some kinks and maybe some menu adjustments and try it again.

Food: A++++

Atmosphere: B (slightly underwhelming, but I like that... it doesn't puff out its chest so to speak and do any ""peacocking""... it doesnt need to.  minimalistic, but has a light creole/jazz/Orleans flair. Background music fits the restaurant very well and is at a perfect volume. The emphasis is on the food and honestly you could feed me this food in the middle of a trash dump and I would still give this place 5 stars...)

Service: A+ (very nice friendly knowledgeable. attentive but not in your face. i never felt annoyed with too much waitress interaction (aka ""how is everything, do you need more water? blah blah blah"".. yet i was never in need of anything. Always had a full glass of water, dirty plates were taken away promptly... very nice)

I'm sooooo glad we came to Zozo's though!  Even though it was a small distance from our house, the ambiance was great for a relaxed Italian joint. 

The service was enthusiastic, prompt, genuine, and helpful.  5 of 5 stars.  I wish I would have asked for our waiter's name before we left, but it truly looked as though all the patrons were being treated just as well as we were.

As for the food - 4 of 5 stars.  The appetizer special - lightly breaded, then fried, artichokes and shrimp with a spicy aoli - was amazing and generously portioned.  The wine selection was varied and easy on the pocketbook.  The salads were as good as one could expect and the entrees pleased as well.  The desserts, however, were complete polar opposites of one another.

My wife's favorite dessert is creme brulee - she gets it almost everywhere we go if it's on the menu.  Me, I tend to take whatever the server recommends, which in this case was the tiramisu.

The raspberry creme brulee was easily one of the three worst creme brulees either of us have ever had.  There was no sugar 'crust' to speak of and the creme was less custard and more soup/wet pudding.  While the raspberry topping looked enticing, it was far too sweet and vastly over-portioned in relation to the rest of the dessert.  We literally took turns bailing it out of the cup with our spoons to save what little good there might be left in the creme.  I'm not trying to be a jerk, but is was seriously awful.   Granted, we ate like half of it because we kept saying too each-other, ""It can't really be this bad, right?  Maybe it gets better further down.... "" No such luck. 

The tiramisu, however, was easily one the the three BEST either of us had ever had.  I can't even begin to describe the levels of gooey goodness that were layered in those soft pillows of rum-laced heaven! :)

All-in-all, even though it ended on a bit of a down note, we will be back, and likely within a few weeks time.  Zozo's is a great place for a relaxed Italian meal served by people who care and food prepared with a hefty appetite in mind.

I was looking forward to getting my hair done and then going out for dinner. I arrived at the salon and was shocked to see the condition of the salon. It was dirty and so outdated. I did not realize that most of the clientele were older individuals. Not that that matters but I definitely felt out of place. I was introduced to my stylist Chris who said she would be with me shortly. She said the client before me was late for her appointment so consequently Chris was running late but I would not have to wait that long. She asked another staff member to do my conditioning treatment first. I found this odd but I don't know, I'm not a hair stylist. Apparently the other staff member found it odd as well and told me that she didn't understand why Chris was having her do this first but proceeded to do it anyway. The staff member applying my treatment was complaining about having to stay late and did not make my conditioning treatment very relaxing. I was then placed under a hair dryer to process my treatment. I sat for over 30 minutes while Chris finished the other client's hair cut and styling. She took her dear sweet time, exchanging photos with the other client. I understand wanting to be nice to clients and make them feel welcomed but I was so annoyed because it was not my fault the other client was late and so I should not have had to wait until an hour after my appointment to actually get to start my color. Finally Chris had me sit at her station and we talked about what I wanted. She was very nice and talkative and agreed to do a low light instead of a high light. The next almost 2 hours consisted of low lights, processing, shampooing, gloss, and a lot of waiting and a lot of listening to Chris blab about everything. She did offer me a drink and was polite. She wanted me to make sure I knew it did not inconvenience her to have to stay late. I was thinking: really??? You are inconveniencing me because you were an hour late to our appointment! I ended up having to change my reservations for dinner because it took over 3 hours for her to finish my hair. The color was barely noticeable. I was very disappointed. When I went to work on Monday, everyone asked me what I had done because they did not notice a difference. She did do a nice job on the cut and style though. By the time I left I was so annoyed and I did not ever want to come back so I just didn't say anything about how disappointed I was in the color. I did tip her and bought some product. 

In summation, I will NEVER go back here nor recommend this place to anyone. They really need to update the decor and hire a cleaning crew or something.

No apps- well no, the ""more impressive than most places entire menu"" salad bar comes with your meal.  I had capris I salad, taboulah, nova lox, hearts of palm and charcuterie.  That's app enough for anyone.

 O alcohol- yep, that stuff ruins your tastebuds, keep a clean pallet with water and tea.  Salty meats and stuff need water to chase them.

No dessert - I was absurdly stuffed.  The Grilled bananas come out with your meal and beat dessert at most places.

The steak, chicken pork and steak and lamb and did I mention steak come out hot and fast.  Unlimited in amounts, so pace yourself to get to the filet and the lamb.  This is the only place I will even touch sir loin and it is absolutely fabulous.

The cheapest wine by the glass is $9 and beers start at $6 but most at $7.  Come during Happy Hour though and drinks are half off and snacks 3 for $12.  Pretty good drink specials at that point, 3:00-6:00.  

We ordered the hummus, bruschetta, and tuna snacks.  Hummus dip was terrific but pita was just ok, kinda hard and room temperature.  The dip was artichoke based which was interesting and had a nice flavor that you wouldn't expect.  The bruschetta was good but nothing special with the tomato looking kinda old.  The tuna was great, over a tiny cup of salad.  I would have loved this a salad/meal. After devouring this dish as an appetizer I was surely craving more.

We also ordered a burger, crab cake salad and gnocchi.  The burger was a nice meal with the shoestring fries but pretty typical.  The gnocchi were terrific and unexpectedly large.  Add in some chicken or chorizo and you'll be full for sure.  The crab cake salad would be a nice refreshing lunch option but for dinner I think it would have been presented better as an appetizer.  Very good and large, but over a pretty bland ""salad"" with just a bed of arugula and crab cake.  Sounds more like a crab cake with a side of greens to me.

the morning. Some of the local buildings are a little rundown, so its 
kind of looking like they aren't really sure what to do with the area.

fruit, and usually some kind of hot entree, bacon, eggs, ham, etc.
So, you can really pack up on breakfast before heading out. Its within
a $10 or so cab ride to the port, the St Pete Times Forum, the 
Aquarium and across the street from a trolley that will take you a lot
of those places for $2 each way, $4 for a day pass. Plus the hotel
has a free shuttle to go within 5 miles of the hotel, for free, that goes

I politely asked if I could substitute fried onions instead of the red onions that come on the sandwich, as I am not partial to red onions.  The employee went to the cook (who was literally 15 feet away from me and facing me) to relay my request, which was greeted with an obvious rolling of the eyes and snort of derision.

However, this was dry and chewy, not at all what should be expected from how this establishment touts its fare.  The cherry on top of the meal was when the cook walked by the 4 of us and made a snide remark about how these sandwiches were her beloved creations, inferring that any alteration to them was a direct affront to her.

It's nice that they have a vegetarian option as well, which I've never seen in other ramen houses. I tried this one and it was just simply delicious.

Nobody ever called me, I then tried to call on Sunday but they apparently are not open on the weekends which no one told me. So Monday morning I sit on hold for thirty minutes trying to get a hold of Melissa because even though I have never spoken to this woman she is the ONLY person in this entire place of business that can help me. She then tells me she'll call me back and let me know. She doesn't. So I called back again and Melissa is busy but I was told she'll call me back. I highly doubt it.

My family and I lived in a rental property managed by The Nordstrom Group for 5 years. They are great while you are renting with them for the most part but lack compassion and basic human decency, for example while we lived there the home got broken into with the door being kicked down and they took 2 weeks to replace the front door so our family was living in an unsafe environment through that time. If minor issues arise they are quick to get them taken care of as long as you stay on them about it BUT they are awful once it's time to move. 
I was given a 30 day notice that the house would be put up for sale and we had to move. That in it self is frustrating but at the time I had just had twins who were living in the NICU so it couldn't have come at a worse time. They could not have been less empathetic to our situation. So we did what we had to do and scrambled to move out in time. 
We kept that place in great condition we repainted the house interior every year, and had the carpets professionally cleaned every 6 months or so (and freshly done for the move), we reported every issue we ever had with the house and got things promptly taken care of.  We cleaned the house very well when we moved out with the exception of the oven and a couple of tiny crumbs left in a kitchen drawer and on the floor in front of it because my toddler was eating as I was waiting for Vanessa to arrive for inspection. I figured it wasn't a big deal and they could take it out of our nearly TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR deposit. I was wrong. Vanessa came to inspect and said they would need to have a cleaning service go in and re clean the entire house because of the crumbs left. She was extremely rude and passive aggressive with comments like ""I understand your babies are in the hospital but this place is unacceptable, it truly is filthy your husband should have hired a professional cleaner if you couldn't get it done."" When it came time for the deposit not only did they refuse to give it back but they tried to charge me $500 more for 2 air filters to be replaced when I just replaced them 3 months prior! So I asked for them to compare the home to when I was given the keys at move in. I wrote down every issue with the home how the walls were filthy, how they left ice in the sink and a full plate of food in the microwave, and crumbs and stains everywhere on the tile  along with tons of pet hair but they refused to do a comparison. Funny thing is in their listing of the home they mentioned how well maintained the home was kept and how move in ready it was using the photos they took during inspection. 
The Nordstrom Group is not a place I'd recommend to anyone they scam you out of your money for the simple reason that they can get away with it. It's a moral-less company with zero integrity.",2017-12-29 16:19:24,négatif,négatif
Bm4De9TLhlUnsHH2nCBuLg,EosqAeelddiMeS1Lk5kYsA,bN8LCQjzfbyrjKbHxRpSeA,5,6,3,4,"Typically, I'm not one to get all excited over Greek for lunch.  Let's just say, I'm not in a hurry to get anyone to the Greek.  Not sure why.  Maybe it's because I just don't get tingly when I hear the word gyro.  Also, I don't eat veal, or lamb.  Simply because they (calves and lambs) are just too cute to consume.  Combine this with the suggestion of a friend who goes to the same sandwich place each and every day for lunch, and I'm like ""Dude, you eat the same sandwich every day, of course a new place is going to taste good."" So I never took Zoya's seriously. 

ADD side note, if anyone ever wants to open their own sandwich shop, here's a free name idea.  Hawgwarts Sandwitches and Sandwizards.  Make sure you spell it Hawgwarts for legal purposes.

Back on track here...Well today I gave in, and said ""Brah, you can pick any place you want brah.""  I throw ""brah"" around liberally.  I also chew my gum with my mouth open, and over extend my jaw whilst in chew brah.  There you have it, I threw him a low hanging curve ball, and whammo.... he hit it to Zoya's for the home run of lunches.  I will admit, I yelped the place before going so I knew it wasn't going to suck based on the reviews.  I'm happy I went, because I now have a killer place to go for my change-of-pace lunch.

So why do they get a 5 star from me?  Well that's really easy.  The food is great! The gyro is plump (not all dry and blah), and the Greek salad is off the chain.  Haven't tried the baklava, but it looked good as all Hades.  They also get your food out relatively quickly, which is nice as well.  Another great thing is their lunch deal.  Greek lunch for 9.99 which includes a plump gyro, off the chain salad, soda, and bread.  It's quite filling, and relatively more healthy than 5 Guys Clogged Arteries, and Fries.  Zoya's lunch is actually less expensive based on what you order.

Another ADD Side note...  My prediction is that those who routinely eat on the west side of Olive, and New Ballas are likely to live longer compared to those who eat on the east.  This is purely speculation, and not the reviews of Yelp and their affiliates.  This comment does not guarantee longevity.  

Ironically though, the name Zoya means ""life"" in Greek.  BOOM!  Mind is blown...",2012-10-03 18:19:47,positif,positif

I'd been wanting to try Han Dynasty for years, but never seemed to get around to it, so my hubby and I booked a reservation and headed down to Olde City.  We arrived and waited... and waited.... and waited.  We waited for 45 minutes, which wouldn't be a huge deal if we hadn't made a reservation.  The hostess was completely inept and would walk away from the podium for long periods of time, during which we saw several other potential customers leave out of frustration.  When we finally sat down, the manager apologized for the wait and offered to get us each a drink on the house (very nice).  However, when he came back, he threw two beers (the cheapest kind they serve, I should note) down on the table and ran off.  Since I don't drink beer, I tried to flag him down and when I finally got his attention, ordered a glass of wine.  He short-poured the wine (poor form, Han Dynasty, poor form--why offer a free drink, if you're not willing to oblige?) 

Anyways, though we were annoyed, we wanted to give the food a fair shot since we'd been hearing raves for so long.  The Dan-Dan noodles are very good--a solidly 4 star dish with some kick.

My pup is a long haired Havanese a who got poop  and bark all over herself and her butt became matted, I gave her a nice bath and while she was still wet and drying my husband called and said "" hey can you take our puppy?"" Last minute so I appreciated that. I promptly wrapped up my pup and brought her in, I told 2 or 3 separate people do not shave her. Please do not shave her. Just a trim, and keep length on her. They said ok. I looked at the notes even as they were doing drive up service due to covid19 so I signed the agreement for my car. Then a younger pretty girl with long brown hair came out and said she could help, and I told her don't shave her. Everyone said ok. I remember even saying "" I don't care how much this costs as long as you take care of her and don't shave her""

Then I get home, around noon maybe Eden called and said how long do you want her hair? I am like OK ?? ‍well I was super nice about it and sent Eden 3 or 4 photos showing her I would like her hair to still be long. Eden put me on hold for about 5 min to ensure the groomer could do what I had  provided in the photos, she came back and said yup all is good , I again stated please don't shave my pup she's a Havanese so she has longer hair. I said thank you and how excited I was to see the pup all cleaned up. Then I got a call saying I could pick her up at 2. Still never mentioning anything about shaving her. 
I get there, while I am in the car I pay $65.00 then they say "" let me get Khalessi "" they bring her back. COMPLETELY shaven. Yup. Then the groomer who I never met ( wasn't the younger girl as I thought) it was an older women wearing glasses who introduced herself as the groomer and proceeded to say she was UNHAPPY with the cut, I bring the nice person I am held in my tears and said "" wow  you shaved her"" she said she was so matted she had no choice / when in fact yes her leg areas may have had a couple knots but I said do not shave my dog 20 times, or more they could have easily called and said sorry we will have to shave her it's the put principle. I still tipped her as I am a good human being. I send a photo to my husband and he says"" they still charged you?"" Yes they did. After many calls and arguments as to the fact that they never even offered to refund my money back or even a tiny bit for the pure inconvenience.... livid. My husband even called and spoke to Eden and Eden said "" yes your right all my notes say don't shave her"" ugh.....livid.
Beyond, this is my dog who should not be shaved and again they never even said sorry to me. Never again will I ever go here , my regular groomer the hairy hound on Hercules was too busy to take her and there is a reason why, they are so busy because they are so good. They would have never done something I asked them not to plain and simple.. Oh and I almost forgot. When I picked Khalessi up she handed her to me and said "" what breed is she""?! Right then I knew I made the worst decision by going there. I wrote it down, I told them I said it so many times, she's a Havanese so I want her hair to remain somewhat long please.

Next up will be a 1440p gaming monitor that I will definitely be picking up here!

The people are always welcoming and the atmosphere is cozy. Lately, though, the cappuccinos/lattes we've been ordering have been warm and not hot. :( This has been the case the last 10 times we've visited, but I don't think it had always been that way. We like to relax and read a book while sipping out coffee, but it's hard to enjoy if we don't drink super fast because the coffee turns lukewarm then cold pretty quickly. I know coffee/espresso needs to be a certain temperature when brewing, but I hope Philter might consider cranking the heat up just a little bit :).

The bar is up front and there are tables in two different dining rooms. The ambiance is sweet...calm with mellow music playing and candles on the table. I appreciated that we could enjoy our meal as well as easy conversation.

We all ordered wine flights and the server left the menu on the table so we could follow which bottle we were drinking from. We all ordered the cab flight and the wine didn't disappoint. 

We started by ordering the fried calamari fritti and beet salad to share. Our server forgot to put the order in for our appetizers but the evening was redeemed when the manager apologized for the over sight and brought our previously forgotten appetizers and said there would be no charge. It was disappointing to not receive our appetizers with our wine, but I appreciated how the over sight was handled. The calamari was fried perfectly and tasted fresh with a broccoli rob pesto. 

My friend and I ordered the duck with goat ricotta polenta, salt-roasted beets, huckleberry mostarda. The duck was cooked very well and the salt-roasted beets added a nice flavor to each bite. My other friend ordered crespelle, lobster & crab filled crepe, lobster sugo, basil hollandaise while the other friend ordered chitarra: clams, lump crab, white wine, parsley. They both were pleased with their meal.

We ended the meal by sharing the tiramasu affagoto budino, soaked in espresso caramel and the limencello cheesecake semifreddo which was a pizzelle sandwich with creamy lemon inside. Both were delicious.

Although our time was spent in the dining room, the bar seemed lovely and the wine selection superb. 

Over all the experience was good. The meal wasn't rushed and we were able to take our time and linger. Our server was very kind and eager to please but dropped the ball a few times. The food was tasty and the atmosphere pleasant.",2017-02-11 06:23:16,neutre,positif

It's a small area and gets very loud inside. I noticed the volume decreased once someone started playing music from the jukebox.

We had about a 20 min wait at 7:30 on a Tuesday night. I'm told that's not uncommon for weeknights.

The windows/walls/decor could use a cleaning. Finish on benches and tables was a bit worn but they were clean. (Really, this is the only reason for not getting 5 stats. )

It's a full bar so they probably have whatever you're drinking. By far the best drink prices we've found in the Quarter; $3.50-$5 for beers, $5-6 for mixed drinks in plastic cup that you can leave with.  I ordered two for the road when we were done.  :)

We started with a side of greenbeans for an appetizer.  They were cooked perfectly and the bacon was a nice touch. 

I had the cajun fried chicken with jambalaya and coleslaw. The coleslaw was  creamy with a perfect blend of cabbage.  The jambalaya was just the right amount of  moisture, with great flavor; Best I've had so far. The chicken was very good and juicy,  but would have liked a little more cajun spice to it.  That's me though- I like a little spice.  

The Duck quesadilla was a little small (8in) but oh so good.

The food has always been great and wonderful wines.  Tonight though I took a friend to enjoy and early dinner.   We got there and a young lady said that the hostess would be right with us.  It took about 5 minutes before the hostess showed up.  Then we had to wait while they took a phone call for a reservation.   We were seat on the patio.   That was very nice.   Our server came and asked if we wanted something to drink.   We were still deciding.   5 to 7 minutes later he came back to get our order (5:05).   We ordered our food then.   Our drinks came we both got sangria.   It was very tasty.   There was no price on the menu for the sangria.   They were not too busy but there was a steady stream of people coming in.  It took a little more than an hour to get our meal.   Which is Cod and the shrimp rigatoni.   So, none of that should have taken and hour to get there.   The food was good and large portions.   We both got full and had leftovers to take home.   Which is a good thing.   My complaint was the slow service from the hostess to the cooks.   Our server did check on us often so at least we didn't feel to forgotten.   My other complaint is that sangria should never cost $15.00 a glass.   We both had a second class but if we had known the it was $15.00 a glass we could have gotten a nice bottle of wine instead.   Yes, the sangria was delicious but $15.00 a glass???  That just about the cost as our food.   I know that drinking in restaurants and bars is where they make a lot of their money but if you are going to charge $15.00 for sangria then that should have the price on the menu.   Especially since the glasses of wine had their prices down.   I know with Covid and things having to have been shut down and then starting back up slowly has been hard but it has been hard on all of us.   So raising prices is expected but then again we all have lost money and maybe even jobs.   So, if Wild Garlic Grill and other restaurants want to have people to keep coming in maybe they should not raise the prices quite so much.   $2.00 to $3.00 more on each menu item in a bit much.   I am not sure if I will go back because I really have always enjoyed Wild Garlic Grill but with prices being so high and service being slow I may not.   I am glad to see that they still had many patrons  filling up the place.

Not a bad thing.  Then you try to speak with a hostess to get a table and EVENTUALLY they will acknowledge you but then on my first visit for Monday Night Football I was told that no tables were available.  Okay, that seemed a bit strange given that I saw at least 5-10 four tops that were completely open and only a couple people who appeared to be waiting for tables by the host station but instead we chose to sit at the bar, have a few drinks, and some appetizers.  Even at the bar service was fairly slow but they made an okay drink and finally the food came out after quite a long wait.  Cochon de Lait tacos were actually quite good - after adding salt.  The side dish of Mac & Cheese was also decent - after adding salt.

The space has huge ceilings and lots of wood and TV's as you would expect from an upscale sports bar, plus the outside courtyard including bar seats that are served through open windows is a pretty cool option.  There only appeared to be one large TV outside though so for watching games it's probably not ideal.  In terms of food it appears Manning's does a decent job for a sports bar other than the kitchen having an aversion to salt so only eat here if you're comfortable adding salt to bring out the flavor in whatever you order.

On my first vist Manning's was average or maybe a bit below - it's obviously got a ton of Harrah's money in it so I don't really call this a ""locally owned"" place despite Archie Manning's involvement.  I'd like to go with 2.5 stars (which Yelp reviews appear to have pegged perfectly) but will round down to 2 and I definitely prefer to spend my money at local places in the future.  However, with the lack of good sports bars in NOLA where you can get a seat and have decent food I may return to Manning's at some point.  I'd like to hope it will be better, but all around there is little indication that much improvement can be expected.",2012-11-13 20:04:59,négatif,neutre

When I didn't receive it by the following Friday, I called to no avail.  I then sent an email in which they replied that they were sorry for the delay and that the wig would be shipped on Monday (4/02/18) and a tracking number sent. When that wasn't done, I called again - no answer.  Then emailed (Tuesday 4/3) at 12.  They replied at 2pm indicating that item is out of stock.  That's it. No documentation of refund/ credit etc.  I called - after about 45 minutes, ""Anna"" answered and was so rude, it was ridiculous.  She seemed upset that I didn't have a six digit order number.  I see now that I provided her with the PayPal requisition number; but I didn't now that.  When asked if she would take a msg for the manager, owner, she stated ""No, you can call back"".  It takes an enormous amount of time to get anyone to answer the phone (as this is the 2nd day of trying).  The phone just goes through a series of prompts/ loops.  Anna hung up on me twice and left on hold twice.   And neither time when I called back (still her) did she once say ""oh I apologize for getting disconnected"". She then put ""Morgan"" on the phone.  She was initially very nice but insisted that I was being rude to her when I asked her about a refund??? I told her absolutely not, I was trying to determine if I could get a refund - as their email was vague and didn't state one way or the other.  She then said ""oh ok"" (perhaps she already thought I was going to be nasty?).  She did indicate I could receive a refund (after repeatedly telling her I don't want any other wig or another color of the same wig) and to look for it in 7 to 10 business days.

I called Honda Finance and learned that there is no Honda-mandated fee, that it was up to the dealer, but had to be clearly detailed in the contract.

When I brought all this to the attention of the finance manager, he punted to a sales manager, who offered to void the contract.  Which I did.

How many people are being taken advantage of,  unaware of these illegal practices  Their greedy short sightedness, cost them a vehicle sale of a friend I brought with me, and of course, the loss of all my future business.

Go to Oxnard, Thousand Oaks or Woodland Hills, all of whom have treated me better. with the several Hondas I've acquired for myself and friends over the years.",2013-08-12 22:37:34,négatif,négatif

With the recent influx of Chinese students (and their fat tuition dollars) this region was bound to get more developed and refined chinese establishments outside of the usual takeout variety and Cate Zone does not disappoint.

First, a note about the décor. Most Chinese restaurants (even the ones that don't cater to white people) suffer from an inferiority complex that makes them overdo the orientalist tropes for the perceived audience. I call this the pagodas, dragon sweat, and panda shit approach to décor. 

Cate Zone busts out of this mold with a decidedly contemporary look. The walls are plastered with NYC transit decorations. You will be sitting on an IKEA Vilmar chair (get one yourself for the low price of $39). There is a wall decoration with a poem in Mandarin that doesn't even attempt make it understandable for English speakers. It's a nice nod to the roots of the guys who run the place and their confidence in their own identities that they don't try to pander to rank orientalism.

As for the food? It's pretty great. I love the lamb skewers. Perfectly cooked and well marbled chunks of lamb that's grilled and then zapped with a generous coat of salt, ground red pepper, and cumin. A favorite of Northwest Chinese people, their lamb skewers are virtually as good as any you'll get on a streetside grill in China. 

Another favorite is the sweet sour pork. Unlike the takeout stuff that's usually immersed in a congealed mess of cornstarch and red sugar sauce, their take is far lighter with a vinegar based sauce and lightly breaded, pork tenderloin cutlets. It's a lighter and far more crisp (and probably authentic) approach to an American classic. 

Also great on the menu is the hot crisp fish, fried fish fillets that are have been buried under a layer of red pepper and sichuan peppercorns. With alternating flavors of heat and numbness from the generous application of sichuan peppercorn, even people with low tolerance for spicy food will be pounding these down like a champ. Just be careful to not swallow too many of the peppercorns whole or you risk your entire mouth going numb.

Lastly their version of braised pork hock is fantastic. Using the same basic setup as the hot fish (buried in chilies and peppercorns), tender chunks of braised and deboned pork hock get subjected to a blast of heat and an infusion of spicy flavor from the chilies. It's a novel combination of things every Chinese chef has in their kitchen.

I've only scratched the surface of the menu here, with the soups and noodle based dishes left untouched. If you are a real fan of Chinese food you owe it to yourself to give Cate Zone a try.",2017-02-09 04:47:37,positif,positif

The cheese and vegetables were so fresh, as was the bread. The tomatoes were some of the prettiest and most flavorful I have found in Tampa Bay. The service was good and attentive. Everyone at my table, about 10, loved their food. I can highly recommend the bruschetta, which had garlic toast, juicy yellow and red tomatoes, basil and a balsamic redux. Yum! 

Parking is a little tight in the John's Pass area, but there is a city-run hourly parking lot a city block away that I can recommend. It costs $1.50 for an hour (( needed 2), whereas a nearby private surface lot was $10! I understand the parking deck, which is slightly closer, is $1 per half hour.

Be sure and save some time to walk out to John's Pass beside the restaurant to see the waterway and the beautiful light at sunset.

I didn't get a chance to see a doc here
First let me tell you I had my cat before my three children,he was raised like a part of the family. 
I wasn't aware of parking so I had walked two blocks with my terrified 19 yr old dying cat, Who has only been out of the house 2 times his whole life, I was out of breath, disheveled when I walked in & the receptionist looked at me crazy for worrying so much about my cat being frightened on the drive/walk over
The atmosphere was very unwelcoming 
A nurse came out and asked to take him to the back until they had a room ready I responded I didn't want him to leave my sight, she also gave me a funny look and walked away 
While we were waiting for a room my cat was scratching at me to get down, there was a small dog in the waiting room on a leash so I made sure to keep my cat close & cornered in a corner so I could scoop him up at any moment, another lady from the reception area screamed at me ""excuse me,you need to keep your cat up off the floor!""
I was really offended at the tone of her voice, i've been to two other vets never having a problem with my cat out of a carrier!
Then the nurse comes out with a carrier and tells me that I need to put him in it!
I explained to her that he has never been in a carrier and he was already terrified I told her I would keep him in my arms she said it was their policy I was not about to put my cat under any more pressure as sick as he was I decided to walk out and go to another vet
I can't speak for the doctors but the people that are working in the front are obviously not animal lovers and are very cold and unfeeling when it comes to someone with a dying pet! I do not recommend this place for that reason.",2016-12-07 20:36:59,négatif,négatif

X9N4x4batJCHiD9DgGOWEw,Bphn00NVT2xTzMWKcB8jOw,TcNZXteosegb1RO4O5hREw,4,5,0,1,"I asked some locals where to eat in New Orleans. I was told that Parkway Bakery and Tavern was the place to go. I was confused at first because I clearly asked where I could get some delicious poor boys, and here I was being directed to a bakery. I was assured that they served poor boys, and a quick look at the website confirmed that. 

After sitting in nearly an hour of traffic coming from Marrero (normally a 17 minute drive, ouch), I came across a huge sign that proclaimed I had arrived at Parkway Bakery and Tavern. There was ample parking in the back. I walked around the building and the vacant house next door to get to the front, and entered through the patio as that seemed to be the main entrance. 

I was unsure whether I should seat myself or order at the counter first. The menu states ""tavern full service"" and ""dining room self service,"" so I proceeded to the counter. I ordered the golden fried shrimp po' boy. $8.10 for the regular, $11.65 for the large. At 12 inches, the large is twice the size of the regular, so I obviously ordered the large (I'm big on price and stuff... Yeah). I asked for it dressed (lettuce, tomato, pickles, and mayo) but light on the mayo. 

My poor boy came out very quickly, and it was nice and warm. I took a few bites, thinking it was kind of dry, and then I realized there was a small condiment stand where I could douse my poor boy with sauce. I took little cups of creole mustard, honey mustard, horseradish, mayo, and tartar sauce. Ketchup and hot sauce were available on the tables. I liked the mayo and honey mustard on the poor boy. The others were just ok, with the exception of the hot sauce, which I didn't try. 

The shrimp was fried to perfection, and there was a perfect amount of lettuce, tomato, and pickles. The mayo was sparse, but that was my own fault for not knowing better. I ended up eating probably the recommended amount of mayo (or more) anyway. I couldn't finish the entire thing, so now I have a few bites left for a late night snack. 

The decor here is casual and laid back. Paintings, pictures, t-shirts, and assorted knickknacks adorn the walls. The employees are friendly, occasionally coming by to check if everything is alright. There are tables indoors, on the patio, and in the tavern area. Happy hour is from 3-7pm, which I would partake in if not for my 30 minute drive back to Avondale. 

The only complaint I had was that the bread was a little bit tough, so it was hard for me to bite off completely. It got a little messy with me wrestling with the sandwich, causing me to get poor boy on my arm, on the table, etc. I also licked my fingers a lot on account of the sauces.

She acted like this was no big deal, which bothers me even more. How dare anyone treat a dog like that. And then I look her up on google and this woman has MULTIPLE complaints against her for abuse to animals.

First visit, 6-1-20:
Met with very friendly staff and my bagel was decent.  Not the greatest, not the worst.  Staff member showed me the assortment of bagels and I chose a salt bagel.  She asked if I wanted it toasted.

Second visit, 6-3-20
Arrived at 10am, started to place my order and the staff member said rudely, ""What???!!!""  Apparently, she couldn't hear me but there is a better way to say that instead of how she said it.  I placed my order again, a salt bagel with butter.  There were two gentlemen waiting before me and they were together.  I stepped back to wait and started my stopwatch.  The other two gentlemen got their orders within 4.5 minutes of starting my watch.  I then waited another 5 minutes before my order came out, making it a total of 9.5 minutes.  During that time, only two people placed orders and one of them called ahead.  It was not busy.

My order was called and before I grabbed it, I asked if the bagel was toasted.  She said it was.  I told her that I didn't ask for it toasted.  She slammed the bagel in the garbage can and said she'd make another then closed the window.  She then came to the order window and informed me that that was the last salt bagel and asked if I wanted my money back or something else.  I told her to give me my money back as I didn't want to wait another ten minutes just to get a buttered bagel.  She got an attitude with me and said, ""WE TOAST ALL OUR BAGELS HERE!""  I took the money and left.

My experience here was horrendous.  For a business that ""prides itself on getting you your fresh food in just a few minutes"", it's a flat out lie.  How long does it take to butter a freaking bagel and serve it without an attitude???  No thanks.

It was the host hotel and I booked through hotels.com and got a cheaper rate than the marathon rate. I have a small dog so when I called to see how much the pet rate was, she said it was only $25 per animal for the entire stay. I've stayed in worse hotels and paid that per night. Driving to the hotel was a little sketchy since the area seemed a little run down. Checking in was easy but the clerk forgot to activate the keys, but both the manager and another clerk bright keys for me to the room. The room was just the king room, and it's the biggest standard room I've been in. I've also worked at hotels for 8 years so I know a thing or two about standard rooms. We were on the first floor and had a little patio that had the grassy knoll and access to the bike path and river. Perfect for my dog to explore. The hotel has a bar and grill that is pretty friendly and brought my dog water and treats. The breakfast buffet was good. They had a guy making omelets right there for you. The park is a mile away on the bike path and downtown boise is a couple miles away. Because of where the room was, one would never know the questionable area it is in.

I mean, pretty big shoes to fill right? I came expecting hearty, quality grub in a low-key setting and that's exactly what I got. You will get called ""darling"" or ""sweetheart"" and you won't be allowed to leave a tip. We came for a late lunch on a weekday to avoid the infamous wait. 

I asked the sweet lady manning (womaning?) the counter for crawfish étouffée with a side of red beans and had it brought it out to me ten minutes later. These ten minutes seemed like forever to me as I drooled over the savory scent of our neighboring diner's gumbo. Ten minutes, and I ate it all in five. AND I was so excited, I didn't take a picture. -hangs head in shame-

To my delight, they really pile on the crawfish in their étouffée. I got at least one or two in every bite. Gotta love them crawdads! The rich seafood stock is not too heavy and does a solid job at bringing all the ingredients together, or ""smothering"" as they say. 
I never tried savory red beans prior to this and surprisingly liked them as well. I also took a bite of the Jerry's jambalaya that my friend ordered and fell in love with the smoky andouille sausage.

Mother's helped convince me that New Orleans has some of the most delectable eats in this country. My friend told me they've remained a local favorite ever since they opened in 1938. I'm glad that they stayed true to their roots after all these years and appreciate that all of their recipes are online so I can try my hand at simmering that jambalaya!

I think they forgot about us a little bit because we were there for over 2 hours so service was slow. They forgot the water my coworker ordered and also sides that came with our meals. I ordered the business lunch and I got the salmon from the restaurant week special  by mistake which is fine I guess and the waitress brought our sides later once we asked. The salmon was moist but very very salty. Once I got the mashed potatoes they were ok too but the chives were overpowering the taste. The skillet chips were actually the best tasting good we had over our three course meals. The chocolate mouse was ok! Overall maybe this place offers better service for dinner.,2013-09-24 18:40:18,négatif,neutre

                                            Plato

So believes Joel Zazyczny, the founder idealist who created Cafe Soul in Doylestown, PA. Scientist, innovator, philanthropist, Joel operates this simple, yet attractive eatery, as a non-profit to work with the younger people of the community in support of music and STEM education programming and scholarships. For this alone he has my admiration and support; for actually pulling off a well functioning breakfast/lunch haven with good food, he has my loyalty. 

Now fully vaccinated against Covid, I visited Cafe Soul for my first professionally made Brioche French Toast in over a year. Walking in, the space was open, clean and prepared for social separation. I sat at a booth in back where I could see the entire room. Soon, I was approached by the young man running the front end. He was friendly and deferential. I did the short stack FT, and a mug of their Ellis Coffee brew. The joe was fresh and strong as expected from Philadelphia's oldest caffeine roaster (since 1854). 

The frenchie was well panned, with plenty of caramelized edges for melted butter and syrup to accumulate. The egg mix tasted of vanilla and cinnamon, just as I like it. But for the Stuckey containers of corn syrup sweetener, it was a strong reintroduction to a favorite and missed morning meal. If real maple syrup had been an option, I would have jumped at the chance for a near perfect indulgence. 

Otherwise, a wonderful first breakfast out in the world again.",2021-05-04 15:47:04,positif,positif

After several days of walking by Spread, I decided to endure the line that was out the door. I ordered an everything bagel with veggie garlic cream cheese. First of all, the bagels here are huge; I had to take half of it home and this coming from a gal whose family nicknamed her ""Bottomless Pit."" 

Typically, bagel shops either put too much or too little cream cheese on the bagel, but Spread does it juuuussst riiight, in my opinion. Bonus: you get a strawberry with your bagel if you eat-in. I don't know why this is a bonus, but it is. They also serve brunch and for $8 you can get some bloody mary mix if you BYO vodka. If these are bottomless bloody's, then that's awesome; if not, I'd rather go to a more restauranty place for brunch.

On the weekend I ordered 2 meals with the usual burgers, fries, gravy and side salad I got the food and it was fresh!  when I arrived home they actually put napkins in the bag as well. 

I hope they have found some new staff to keep the grills hot and the gravy in full supply. It seems like such a no brainer but this location has been unable to be consistent until now!

The decor and atmosphere is homey and cozy, matching the family style experience at a communal table (for a flat rate per person, you enjoy a dozen or so dishes to your belly's content). 

Pro tip: while they do not serve alcohol, you can bring your own booze for a very modest corkage fee (depends on what type of alcohol, but around $5). There is a liquor store about five minute walk from the restaurant.

The whole meal was delicious, but my favorites were:
-Coleslaw: I usually don't enjoy this, but the lightness/thinness was refreshing and delicious 
- Biscuits and gravy : amazing.
- Fried Chicken: the fry was great, though could have been spiced in my opinion 
-meatloaf- tasty but should be cut in smaller portions to avoid waste 
-Mac and cheese -runny cheese sauce just how I like, and cute roundish noodles that were fun to eat 

Could be improved: 
- mashed potatoes could have been creamier, they tasted a bit like instant potatoes to me
- sweet tea was too sweet for me but good when mixed with lemonade. Would have appreciated an unsweetened option
- should be a couple more bottles of hot sauce for the table, it was annoying to keep having to pass the hot sauce back and forth during my meal

Last week we decided to order takeout and have the lamb burgers.  Huge mistake!!  The first sign should have been when the young lady who answered the phone placed me on hold and never came back to get my order.  I called back and asked for the manager.  After explaining to him what happened he apologized took my order and said it would be ready in 15 minutes.  My husband arrived approximately 20 minutes later.  Our food wasn't ready...small inconvenience except there seemed to be some confusion around where the order was and why it wasn't in the empty bag sitting on the counter.

Fast forward to opening the food at home and discovering 2 overcooked, dried out lamb burgers.  I called the manager who at first tried to explain to me the texture of ground lamb (I've had great lamb burgers at several different places and also make my own).  He later said he would reimburse us for the food. Needless to say we are still waiting.

Also, the waffle looked like it was just thrown in the box with no powdered sugar on it. On the menu it is described as being doused/covered with powdered sugar. 

Hattie B's has a terrible process in taking your pickup order. It's probably because they seem to have a long line you have to wait in so they don't prioritize pick up orders. If you're a tourist please go check out Boltons or Princes Hot Chicken which is across the street. It's much more authentic without the wait. 

I tried calling Hattie B's to solve this issue but I have been left on hold for 12 minutes. Finally a guy picked up at 12 mins and then said please hold. Your customer service is terrible.

WE INSTEAD WENT TO STEAK & SHAKE AFTERWARDS WHERE THE FOOD WAS MUCH BETTER.  LETS HOPE THAT THE KITCHEN NIGHTMARES - GORDON RAMSAY LIKE CONSULTANT CAN HELP TURN THIS PLACE AROUND.

 I would give Shiraz 1.5 stars.  I had a mixed overall  experience at Shiraz.  The concept sounded interesting and my wife, my friends, and I decided to give it a try. 

 PROS:  Shiraz is in the new and trendy Arts & Design District of Carmel, IN.  The place looks new, has two levels, and the upstairs section where we were seated felt like a neat, trendy living room.  Interesting/ good concept where there are wine dispensers and you get a swipe/ account card and can try different wines.  You can choose small, medium, or large wine fills. 

CONS - THE FOOD:  It needs a serious overhaul.  We tried to order several small plates for a group.  The waiter came back on several occasions after 20-30 minutes stating that they were out of what we ordered.  The owner then stated that everything was on the menu.  Then more feedback from the kitchen and waiter: So with 2-3 not available, and we ordered alternatives.  The lobster mac n cheese for $15 was not worth it.  It was like a dry store bought mac n cheese box where water was added.  The cheese was very little and tasteless and there was only two or three very small pieces of lobster - which took some effort to find.  The crab cakes tasted very fishy and we wondered it they were spoiled.  There were also a couple of shell fragments in crab cakes.  The beef skewers were very dried out, burned, and overcooked. The flat-breads looked like they came out of a freezer/box from the grocery store.  The toppings were skimpy.  We returned the food and got our money back.  

CONS - SERVICE:  While we got our food refunded, the owner (older lady) got upset at our criticism of the food, yelled back at us, and called us Midwestern Hicks.  I disagree - my wife and I are foodies from the Chicago area.  We have traveled internationally and several times to California to San Francisco and Sonoma County - where the owner claims the concept came from.  

GORDON RAMSAY-LIKE CONSULTANT:  We talked to a gentleman there and he mentioned that he was a consultant hired by the owner. He was nice and professional, and agreed that the food on the menu needed an overhaul. He said the owner had threatened to fire him several times when he offered her constructive criticism.  

OVERALL:  This place has potential, but the food offerings need to be improved or dropped all together. Also, the owner needs to be more professional like the consultant when offered both compliments and criticism.  The food at Steak and Shake was much better.",2012-02-27 21:43:22,négatif,négatif

Between the three of us, we ordered three entrees, a bottle of wine, and three beers. The food was fine and service was great, and our night would have been perfect, if it hadn't been for the following: about 50 minutes after we sat down (20 minutes after we finished eating), the server told us that their manager was asking when we were going to be leaving. We didn't want to immediately get up and leave (we still had drinks), so we continued our evening and finished our drinks. For the next 10 minutes, we were very conscious of employees talking about us and staring at us, and even heard a server tell some customers, ""they won't leave,"" and gesture towards us. So, after finishing our drinks and an hour after we were seated, we got up and left. A server on our way out said a very sarcastic ""thankkkksss.""

If this review was for food or service (from our server), this would be a 4 star review. However, it would not be fair to rate this restaurant more than 1 star when three people, trying to enjoy our weekend and spending our hard earned money on a nice meal, all felt so mistreated and unwanted that it spoiled our night. I don't know if it's because we are younger than most of their clients (we're in our mid 20s), or if they just don't know how to handle a busy night, but it was an awful end to a good meal.

I usually do not write long reviews, but it is necessary this time. Take the time to read this, and you will understand the RIGID program at The Fox, then see the end cartoon.  I got the cartoon idea from my friend Ron M. (Master Yelper and cool dude!

This was my 4th time here.
     
      They follow their rules, and are diligent about them, in some cases the point of being overly ""direct.""  This works for and against you, the customer, depending upon what your goal is for your evening.  
     
     You want to stop by and have a drink after a dinner elsewhere with a date for an hour or so? It will cost you $50 plus a tip - pretty steep. ($3 for Valet, $10 each for cover and $22 for 2 drinks+tax, and a $4 tip)

     You decide to have DINNER HERE, (see food review, below) you get a reserved table, a spot to sit all evening, and it all rolls up to a whole evening experience. HOWEVER YOU STILL PAY $10 EACH FOR COVER.  Still its an above average experience - for your date. For me, (the ""GUY PAYING THE BILL"" and the person that decides whether to bring a date here again!) it would have been nice if I could have left there feeling ""great"" too.... - it was ""Just above OK"" for me due to the way the cover/dinner rules/valet are handled.

2.  At the narrow entry way, a ""Bouncer/Doorman/Rule enforcer type guy"" is blocking entry behind while you speak to a very polite hostess.  In a wider entry way, maybe this would not look/feel so ""unsettling.""  I'm 6'6"" weigh 230, and I rarely have a feeling like this.  Maybe it had to do with the guy pointing out (a bit loudly) in front of my date that ""Your shirt needs a collar!"" rather than smiling, and whispering to me ""hey, in the future, we require a collar""... It was a $104 Tommy Bahama shirt...without a collar. For the record, collar rule - good -  how the message was delivered -bad-  on top of a $23 pre-entry routine.

INSIDE: 2 band areas, both very different, both very nice! Clean, intimate lighting, nice 'vibe"" in each room. Nice, modern, clean restrooms with TV screens, very cool, very high end.

SERVICE: Excellent, and our waitperson was attentive, polite and just plain nice. 

FOOD:  We ordered crab cake appetizer (excellent), and steak on toast with blue cheese (good) appetizer. A bit later, we ordered the blue cheese house made chips (good).  We each had two drinks, the house Cabernet ""the Show"" is good.  My friend had 2 cocktails, and was happy with what she ordered.  

MUSIC: The jazz quartet is very good, and the volume during the time we were eating was at a level where we could still talk.  After most diners had finished, they turned it up, and that worked for us. Very professional group, and very talented.

OVERALL: We had a nice time, we tipped the piano player well, and he signed a CD and gave it to us....very nice!  That made the evening for my friend, and that was the goal of the evening, that she had a nice time.  I got over the initial ""bad vibe"" and enjoyed the evening, too.


After the evening was over:

We were there about 1:30/2 for a late lunch.  Our server took forever to come to our table for drinks.  My wife ordered a milkshake and he never even got it til he was almost done with his meal.  He also ordered an egg on his burger but they forgot it.  We asked the server to remove the charge from the bill before she even brought it but of course it was still on the bill.  We asked her again to remove it and she didn't and still charged us.  I had purchased two $20 gift cards from through the Idaho Statesman discounted gift card event they had a while back. When I went to redeem them she only redeemed them for $12 each, which is the discounted price I had purchased them for.  I tried to explain that was how the Statesman gift card event worked, that I really had paid for two $20 cards.  She had no idea what I was talking about so safe to say my gift cards went to waste.

A coworker of his recommended this restaurant to him about six months after we moved here. But with work and life happening we put it off until this past weekend, when we finally to come out to Marrero and give it a try. As we were driving, I was on Yelp looking at the menu and reading the reviews. I mentioned to him that they weren't great and maybe we should just go grab something else. We got there and the outside is okay, nothing special. The host opens the door and greets us, she was very welcoming and takes us to out seat. Our server comes over and takes our drink order, French 75 for myself and Anita Amber for him. She brings our drink and we order boudin balls as our appetizer.

Then we get our side salad, I normally don't expect much from a side salad but it was sad, just a few leaves thrown together. Then we get our entrees, my chicken(comes with jambalaya) looked so good. I looked over at his dish and his looked at his steak and it looked a bit weird. Like I said my chicken looked so delicious, I cut my chicken and ate a small piece. Okay let me tell you, I've tasted chicken like this when I first learned how to cook.. because it wasn't cooked!! It was chewy and all I wanted to do is spit it back out. But it was too late and I just swallowed it. I cut a few more pieces and just looked over it, and it wasn't cooked.. we waited 30+ minutes for our food, so we didn't care to wait longer. The jambalaya was good but not great and that's all I could eat, chicken was left uneaten. His steak was bland, nothing to write about. Our server asked if it was good, we just said yes. We wanted dessert but I was so grossed out I just wanted to go home, we even took the food to go to throw it out ourselves.

Based on what I've eaten so far, I do hope this place sticks. 

He's doing not only a full take out menu, he's also doing a lunch buffet Monday to Friday for $9.95.  The buffet includes your choices of about 4 meat entrees, wings, potatoes, and pasta with meatballs.  It also includes soups, salad, and bread.  Oh by the way, it also includes your choice of pizza. 

I was stunned the first time I had it. I couldn't believe he was offering all of this for the price. 


Everything I've had has been of pretty high quality. The wings are charbroiled and baked, and they come out juicy with good flavor. Most everything is made on the lighter side so you don't leave there feeling like you overindulged (Tony, the owner, tells me he doesn't like to fry anything unless he has to).  The soup has been excellent. They make the house salad to order. The bread is toasted nicely drizzled with olive oil. And, they offer more pizza slices than just the basic cheese and pepperoni for you to try. You can actually get a more gourmet slice out of the deal. Service has always been very accommodating too. 

The best thing is, you don't have to go for the buffet. The full take out menu is available so you can just go for a couple of slices if you want for lunch. I haven't been for dinner yet, but they offer a pretty extensive dinner menu as a BYOB.

2. Trainers will literally walk up to an area where paying members are working out / using equipment and kick you off to work with a client. This has happened to me on multiple occasions, really kills a workout flow. 

Like I said, I used to really like working out here. It's sad that I find it frustrating when I go to the gym now. Management could easily fix these problems with a simple talk to trainers to respect members workouts and a conversation with new members to explain what gym etiquette is (wipe down equipment after sweating on it, don't hog machines for hours, try and stay busy on equipment you're using especially if it's busy and people are waiting, basic stuff really.. apparently some people need to be told.)",2021-12-19 16:41:26,neutre,négatif

Although I love Chinatown, the quality and the not-so-greasy (fresh) food at this restaurant is hard to beat. My friends from out of town usually request to meet there. I've been going there for years and it's always been my secret place for Chinese food since it's up in the suburbs. I'm usually eating in the city and having a glass of wine (or a bottle) could become pretty pricey with a few friends. We usually take advantage of the BYOB with the wine and spirits right there.

We share it family style so everyone gets to try a bit of everything. Our favorite starter is Chicken with Lettuce Wraps since it's not too heavy and we enjoy the concept of using lettuce as your edible bowl or wrap. Sometimes, we fulfill our craving and go for some of the steaks, Orange flavored beef, or the soft shell crabs. The steak is always tender and tasty and the soft shell crabs are crispy even with the sauce. The kids usually enjoy the General Tso Chicken and the Lo Mein. I've tried the chicken at several other places but most places are too soggy, too sweet, barely any meat and too much batter. Sometimes I treat myself to Seafood w/ Crispy Pan Friend Noodles. I would say that is one of my favorites because the noodles at the rim are crispy yet the middle has a nice sauce that softens it. The seafood is fresh. 

I also like getting the moo shu pork since the kids are picky with veggies. Everything is cut small and mixed together so when the kids have fun making the wraps while eating the veggies.

Very tough and it had a weird, almost burnt flavor.  I think the restaurant refried leftover chicken from the previous day or the chicken sat under a heat lamp all day.

I thought it was really odd that not all of the employees were in uniform... One guy walked out of the kitchen wearing sandals!  The restaurant is in dire need of remodeling and spring cleaning.  The restaurant has these huge, unsightly fish tanks with tilapia and crabs.  We watched an employee scoop out a tilapia from the tank...

Our first room was Division 37- but before I get into our feelings on the room I think it's important to mention some things that created our positive first impression. This place has a small lobby/waiting area but has 5 different rooms! Firstly I so appreciate that they put a star difficulty level on their rooms - this makes it really simple as a first timer to know what room to pick. The staff are friendly and quick to greet you as you enter. We had some discount off cards and they were applied really easily and taken off our bill- which we paid at the beginning before we did our room. The orientation is so well done- I really appreciate that they take the time to show you the locks you're going to encounter in the rooms as well as clarifying that the laminated cards are not to be removed if they are stuck to a box or something. Great low down on what to expect. 
Into the room! Such fantastic props in Division 37- that really stuck out to my husband who is an avid Airsoft guy. He really enjoyed it. We only had 4 people in our group but that was probably just right as the space in the room is a little tight even for 4. All the rooms at Exit take 2-6 people. We literally were on the last clue and very nicely the guy let us finish and solve it to have that accomplished feeling since we were so class to the end. 
The second room we did was Medieval- we thought the idea of choosing your own story either following the path of Merlin or King Arthur was so unique! Something we have not heard any other escape rooms doing yet! You have to find your hints and the staff are quick to come aid you. We found the puzzles in this room actually harder than Division 37 and had to use all three hints on our quest so that caused a bit of frustration. 
Overall I enjoyed this escape room and am excited to see that they are looking at expanding in Edmonton. We would definitely recommend this place to people who have never done an escape room before because they create a good first timers experience.",2017-02-01 18:00:20,positif,positif

My first interaction is with a female on the phone taking my order.  There is a notable strong language barrier.  I'm not always understanding what she is saying; however, she seems to understand me perfectly.  So the ordering process was slightly difficult, however everything was delivered correctly.  On completing the order, I was given a 45 minute time frame for the food to arrive.  I must say, they were quick, the arrival of my lunch was only 20 min.

Today I ordered the fried dumplings, and a lunch special of general tso's chicken.  The dumplings were very good.  They have one side fried, and just a light brown color with a nice crispy texture.  The filling in the dumplings was very tasty, I'm unsure of what they are filled with, and I didn't ask.  It is a meat product of some type and delicious.  They are delivered with a brown watery type dipping sauce.  This is also very good, slightly salty, with a tangy finish, as well as a hint of onion.  The lunch special size was plenty of food, there is at least enough for 2 meals.  It was very hot on arrival, so hot that I was able to burn my tongue attempting to eat it.  It the general tso's chicken served with fried rice, and an egg roll.  The fried rice is cooked perfectly.  The vegetables in the fried rice taste quite fresh as well.

Two Adults

Atmosphere - 5 stars
Food - 4 stars
Service - 4 stars 

Background - I am back because it is Reno's Craft Beer with Drake's being offered up.

Atmosphere - The place has been opened for a few years now and it has more character than when I first went.  Pictures of their customers cover the walls now.  Still lots of TVs for your sports games.

Food
  Drink - The reason I came.  I had a Drake's Hopocalypse Green Label which is a double IPA.  The beer came from a boomer, 22 ounce bottle; I was hoping it was on tap.

  Lunch - I had the Golden Rush Burger, they had me with the avocado.  Nice thick slices of it on the burger.  I had one spot that had too much mustard but that happens.  Is it a $15 burger?  The burger was a half pound burger and had a lot of toppings.  Strange thing is they do not mention the size of the burger in the Steak Burger section but in the Starters section under the Pat LaFrieda Ghost Pepper Sliders.  I picked the tots instead of fries at no additional cost.  I recommend a getting them with garlic parmesan or Cajun spice added, the tots were pretty generic without them.

Service - Lucky Beaver supplied good service.  But the best part was they got two guys from Drake's in that day to talk about their beers.

Future - Their burgers were really good, I could see coming back for another burger.  My wife at the sliders and heat was intense.",2016-05-17 01:41:37,positif,neutre

I went in and ordered. It's small on the inside. More catered towards take out. You order your choice of pasta and your choice of sauce and whether or not you want meat. I chose Penne, with Cajun sauce and grilled chicken. It took him about 10-15 minutes to make. I assume it's because it's made fresh. 

They have a selection of salads, ice cream and desserts too. But I just got the pasta. Forgot to get a drink. Oops. 

When it did come out, it came out in a take out plastic bowl. (More catered towards takeout) 

Chicken was tender and moist. The pasta was fresh. The sauce was excellent and peppery. There were onions and bell peppers too. I cleaned my plate.  I want to try all the other sauces now!

They don't have water on tap to drink. Only bottles. Plus side, it's only a dollar. But I like to drink so I typically drink more than 500ml

So my coworker went to this restaurant and got a salad. It had a long hair in the lettuce.  We took the salad back and she showed it to the mgr(I guess that's who he was). He looks at the hair and says that's a long hair.  He looked at the dude beside him and says now who's hair could this be that works in the kitchen? We looked at him like wtf. He takes the salad to the and brings it back.  He says this is a expensive salad you're having us remake and the hair doesn't match anyone in the kitchen. Ummmm what sir??? She told him it was a expensive salad when I bought it. I'm pretty sure that's not good business.  He had an attitude about it and didn't even offer any compensation or apology.

We have seen Yazoo beers on draft throughout the South, so were not especially motivated to check out the brewery while we were in town.  But oddly (I mean, this was really strange to us), Yazoo is the ONLY brewery in town open before 4pm on a Friday.  We needed a Friday afternoon activity, so we stopped in.  

We got super lucky because Yazoo was having an anniversary party, so drafts were incredibly cheap and there was a festive atmosphere, but even at full price, this would have been our favorite stop.  To me, the point in visiting the source is to try beers you can't normally find.  Yazoo totally delivers by having some special stuff on tap, including a couple of different wild and sour beers, at least two different IPA's and a gose.  

Seating inside is ample and comfortable, kind of middle of the spectrum in terms of breweries that run from super sleek/restaurant-like to garage/warehouse-like.

We always stop there on Fridays to grab a loaf of challah for Shabbat.  Great challah for sure with or without raisins.  They also never seem to run out, which is also a plus.

My wife forbid me from bringing them home anymore (although it is amazing warmed with  some plugra butter and home-made strawberry freezer jam).  They also have a great sourdough loaf as well.

My main regret and the reason I would not rate them higher is their hours of operation.  They close at 6PM during the week, and a few times I have showed up with 5-10 minutes to spare and they are already shut tight.

So we went to Acme and there was a line and there was a line across the street at Felix's as well. That's when we decided to do the Bourbon House. No line there should have been a warning. The oysters were small and not cheap ($17 for a dozen) but that wasn't the worst part by any means. This is supposed to be a nice restaurant and the service SUCKED. We sat at the oyster bar and the first server was disinterested and lame. We had to ask for menus and then for water and then for our food and then for our napkins and then remind him we were waiting for drinks. The other server had no clue who at the bar ordered what and so every time he brought out an order he first asked us if we had ordered it. Finally when, after much hassle, i was able to get the bill, I noticed I had been charged $15 for my shot of Makers Mark 46 as opposed to the $10 it was supposed to cost. I asked Drew (the second server) about the cost difference and he said, ""Oh, all of our shots are served in a complimentary shot glass. If you don't want it, you can go to the host station and turn it for the $5."" WTF is that!! What sort of stupid slimy move is that when that's not mentioned anywhere on the menu or by the server? They just obviously hope customers don't check their bill - which most probably don't - so they can scrape another $5 off each one.

On October 11, 2017 I rented a car from Budget at Philadelphia airport when I went to see my dad in the hospital.  When I arrived the shuttle bus was packed with people.   I ran off the bus and was fourth in line.  There were two regular customer service reps and one for their Fastbreak clients. 

When the one rep was finished with her customer she left.  The other rep was having a problem with a customer's license and went in the back to get the manager.   He came out.   The line now had over 15 people inline and growing.   I thought for sure the manager would notice and get help or at least jump in there himself.  But NO he went back behind the wall to his office.   The Fastbreak rep then disappeared.   So now there was only one rep to handle all the people in line.   It was now over 40 minutes.  So I called the number I found for that location to see if I could reach the manager.   I could hear it ringing in the back office.   It rang for over 10 minutes.  No one picked up the phone. Finally the second rep returned from the back.  She had apparently gone on lunch break since she was still chewing something when she returned.   My wait was almost an hour before I had my car.   I can't image how long those at the back of the line had to wait.  Then when they brought my car around, the guy that brought didn't even check to make sure it was mine.  He just walked away. 

BUT IT GETS WORSE.........My return flight was at 6am on October 17, 2017.  So we were at Budget with the car around 4:30 am.   We pulled up and there was no rep to check in the car.   We looked around.  One car was running another had its lights on but there was no one around.   So we walked to the building.  A man was waiting there for a rep and had been waiting for about 10 - 15 minutes.  He said he saw no one.   So I decided to check in the back, where I had seen the manger go when I picked up the car.   I called down the hallway but got no answer.  I slowly walked down the hall calling out ""Hello is anyone here?""  Finally at the end of the hall there was a young woman sitting at a table eating chips.   When she saw me she told me customers were not allowed and I needed to get out of there. 
I told her we were trying to drop off our car.  She told me, in a very nasty tone, to wait in the front because she was on break.  I asked her name and she replied ""My name is Get Out Of Here."" I told her I was concerned because I wanted to get to my flight.  She became angry and told me just to get out.   She said I could leave the key in the car and take the Avis shuttle because that was what they do early in the morning.   I said it would be nice if there was a sign with those instructions.  She just told me I did not have to be sarcastic and again told me to leave.  She was VERY NASTY and refused to give me her name.  ... and kept eating her chips. 

So we left the key in the car and walked to Avis to catch the shuttle.  I advised the other man waiting to do the same.   I prayed that no one pulled in behind my rental and hit the car.  I did not want to be blamed for that.   

READ THIS TOO:  

When I got home I received a survey request.   I gladly completed it and detailed my experience.  To my surprise I received an email from Theresa Evans stating she was sorry I had a bad experience and would like to speak to me about my experience.   I replied OK and sent my phone number.   When I did not hear from her, I emailed her again from a different email (thinking maybe the first one went to junk).  Again, I told her to contact me and gave my phone number.   Well no surprise...... She NEVER contacted me.   So much for being sorry.   I bet she told her boss she responded to me but I did not respond to her.   

It was terrible service from start to finish!   This was not the first bad experience with Budget (I had a bad one in Newark, NJ earlier this year) but PHL was definitely the worst.  I will NEVER rent from Budget again.   I will pay more for a rental so that I know I will get good service.  I guess you get what you pay for.",2017-12-06 19:27:08,négatif,négatif

However, it was so crowded that there was no place to sit. You pretty much had to fight for a table so I decided to just take my sandwich to go. I ended up ordering the muffaletta ($12) and it was just okay.

The only break from the grease is the olive salad, but there was really little in my sandwich. I think a bit more would've helped. I did enjoy the bread though. It was fresh and perfectly toasted.

I think I may have ordered the wrong type of sandwich for my taste. I like more fresh ingredients versus just a bunch of cured meats so that's partly my fault, but I have no problem eating a good old pastrami sandwich so it's not like I don't enjoy meaty sandwiches!

And although the food is horrible, flavorless, and completely falsely advertised as ""healthy"" and ""organic,"" this rating is because the owner is one of the worst businessmen I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. A few months back, Bryn Davis ""hired"" a few friends of mine to work on various programs. After weeks of promising these individuals compensation, he never followed through. He also buys much of his fruit from Sam's Club, which I can pretty much guarantee is not organic. He cares very little about the quality of his food. Instead, he will cut all corners to afford cheap product but will continue to claim that it's all natural or all healthy. 

Bryn has been advertising corporate events and a bryn and dane's food truck. The truck is a piece if junk that can barely even make it down the road without harming someone. Anyone who has seen this truck knows what I'm talking about. These corporate events are a complete and utter joke and a harm to people on the road. I can't even imagine what the back of the kitchen looks like. 

Back to the food - smoothies are okay. I got extremely sick from the mo green smoothie once, and I'm pretty sure that's because there were ingredients in the smoothie that weren't listed, but most of the time they are decent. The food, on the other hand, is basically a bunch of flavorless mush with an expensive price. Basically - DONT GO TO THIS PLACE -  TRUST ME. you will be unbelievably disappointed. 

As for Bryn Davis, here's some business advice: spend less time posing in pictures with celebrities, trying to be famous, and holding bogus ""healthy"" events just for an excuse to drink in public.

These were thick-cut, rich in taste [gratis the duck fat, one presumes], not actually greasy, but definitely better when ordered with the cup of cheese sauce on the side.

They have a daily special and also keep some German beers on tap - yum.

I had the schnitzel special, which turned out to be a pork schnitzel with a mild cheese topping, and you can choose your side - iirc, the options were fries, garlic mash, or spaetzle (fried dumplings). My co-worker who ordered the mash said it was amazing, and I really liked the dumplings. The servings are huge, very few of us could even finish our dishes and had extras left to take away.

The schnitzel itself was a little bland, to be honest; seemed like a little more seasoning or at least salt and pepper would have been an improvement. So, not blown away by the schnitzel, although my companions all enjoyed their orders, but there's a ton of other things to try on their extensive menu. And did I mention the menu includes a rather humorous timeline of the business? We had a lot of laughs reading through the ups and downs of Barb & Ernie.

It's not hard to ruin ""baked eggs"" over grits, but then you get a mess of scrambled eggs.

Second course was insalata di arance alla siciliana. Fresh mixed greens and oranges with a nice citrus olive oil dressing. 

Wife had the black truffle sacchetti and loved it while I did a traditional rigatoni carbonara with a side of meatballs. I hadn't had carbonara in a while and this didn't disappoint creamy and salty with past done perfectly. Three big meatballs with flavorful red sauce on the side made the dinner.

otktgw4vBneEeZwecJnbBg,5O3VvfDu_HDvgUviAqmTEA,4Ry0DT7iq0MavuRk0V-mHA,3,16,2,1,"After being a member at LA Fitness Signature for almost a year and a half I decided to cancel my membership. Initially, this gym was great, but this gym has multiple issues.

OVERCROWDED
As more members have joined this gym and the gym is reaching full capacity LA Fitness has become too crowded. Between peak hours 5 to 7pm Mondays thru Fridays it is nearly impossible to get a parking spot. Once you find parking there is usually a wait for cardio and weight equipment.

CLASS SCHEDULE
The class schedule doesn't change often so the class times either work for you or they don't. In my case, they did not. I wanted to take cycle classes, but they were always at 5:30pm or 7pm. I would have also liked to seen more of  a variety of classes offered.

CLEANLINESS 
There is always a film of dust and dirt on the cup holders and television screens of the ellipticals and treadmills as well as the fans on the treadmills. It doesn't help that the South Tampa members feel too entitled to wipe down the machines after using them. 

TOWELS (or lack of)
If you work out during peak hours it is not uncommon for the gym to run out of towels. For $50/month you would think LA Fitness could afford to buy more towels. If the members aren't returning the towels my suggestion is to have members trade their keys or ID for a towel. When members return their towel they get their keys or ID back. 

DESIGN
While the floor to ceiling glass windows look attractive from the outside these windows cause several issues in the club. The cardio floor is miserable during the day because the sun is shining on the treadmills and ellipticals. The glare of the sunlight also makes it difficult to see the television sets on the cardio equipment. The windows also provide no privacy so everyone on Dale Mabry can watch you work out and those walking by the pool/hot tub area can see everything.

While I still believe LA Fitness is one of the better gym options in Tampa this ""Signature Club"" did not meet my expectations.",2014-05-26 03:40:23,neutre,négatif

My husband and I come from three cultures and we wanted a caterer with the ability to capture those meals to share with our new families. Mike not only did it, but he went above and beyond and even changed from stations to family style as more family flew out for our wedding. It was the perfect choice and he did an amazing job! He isn't just involved in food, he was at every meeting, every phone call- he even picked up something he didn't have to that I forgot!

Our last visit's unpreparedness cost us 1.5 hours of waiting for a routine medication that was schedule weeks in advance and an mistake in the billing (albeit less than 5% of the total bill) was annoying and added further evidance of a lackluster system.

They offer beautiful, hearty soups, a smallish, inventive, tapas menu (I hope they add a few more), some other plates and a divine cheese plate and charcuterie spread too. You can choose to combine the two for a little more $, and both would easily feed 2 people as a meal or 4 people as an appetizer.

He's quick on his feet to help you pick out a great wine, he's engaging and he knows his stuff! Extra Bonus!

My staple here is the Burrito Vera Cruz with extra potatoes substituted for the fruit (ha, that's a no-brainer). The servers are always polite and very agreeable to making changes to menu items. When I go for lunch, I usually opt for the Heard of Buffalo Chicken Wrap with bleu cheese. Very tasty!

I'm not a coffee drinker, but my friends seem to be in unanimous agreement that the coffee at First Watch is terrible--hence the four stars instead of five.

Simply delicious to the point where I'm craving it and make the drive from downtown to whyte ave and have even made a point to go in mid rainstorm. I've only tried the entrees once before and they were pretty delicious from what I recall. I had a late night chai latte on a date with my boyfriend a few weeks before and it tasted very authentic and didn't taste like the typical chai syrup that is generally used, I could be wrong, but it tasted great. I had a taste of my bfs latte as well and I was impressed. It is pretty hard to find a good latte around town. We were both impressed by the amount of cakes/pies available and might have to add on to my chocolate peanut delight on my next visit. 
One negative thing I must mention...one of the last times I went, I went with my mom who is particular about a lot of things and does have strong opinions, but for once I did have to agree that this was unacceptable..We went in to grab some ice cream..the line was long but not out of control, so when it was our turn to order I had my scoop quickly filled and then the girl behind the case accidentally dropped the scoop on the floor..what does one usually do when something like that happens especially in a food establishment..? Get a new utensil to use or properly sanitizing the dropped tool. well, this young blonde decided that a quick splash of water was appropriate and continued to scoop on. Naturally my mother reacted and yet the girl still didn't even attempt to do anything about it and instead tried to defend her spray off as an appropriate reaction. Needless to say, not OK. If I witness something like that again I wont be returning even for my beloved ice cream.

Once again, kicked off with the Calamari in Ginger Juice for an app ($6).  Once again, it was fantastic. 

I took the advice of Zach X. and tried the Shredded Pork w/ Garlic Sauce ($9).  It was pretty damn good, with flavors that reminded me of hot and sour soup.  It was a bit too saturated in sauce, however.  Great portion and plenty to take home.

Now the not-so-good.  We wanted a vegetable dish so we went for the ""Chinese Vegetable Surprise"" or something like that ($8).  It was a gamble that did not pay off.  It was basically a ton of bok choy leaves with pieces of tomato and eggplant, drowned in some sort of brown sauce.  Unfortunately the sauce was kind of slimy.  I couldn't imagine actually eating a piece of the slimy bok choy.  I did pick off some of the pieces of eggplant which were also slimy, but pretty tasty.  But overall I really can't see anyone enjoying this dish.

Our service, while friendly, was not very attentive.  We had to flag the waitress down a couple times.  They seemed understaffed.

FaSuD_XWcf6SrTFc0IYyGA,yKf_BVHbP8wEdCTM2k0shQ,EMviUh7Lud2nqnarrqi_tQ,2,2,0,1,"This hotel is ideal for someone who is looking for a place to stay for a night. I wouldn't suggest this hotel for anything longer than a night (or two, max). It's a small room but if you need a place to crash for the night, it serves it's purpose. My girlfriend and I were recently there and it was a very stressful situation. 

After speaking to a nice woman named Danielle, I made our reservation over the phone. I happened to call back the following day with a quick question. The man with a very strong Indian accent (I can't use the word ""gentleman"" because he was one of the MOST rude, ignorant individuals I have ever come across) I spoke to on the phone, (his name was Paul) could not find our reservation even after supplying him with the confirmation number 3 times and spelling out my last name several times as well. Paul did not seem to care if he found our reservation in the system or not. Finally after going back and forth with someone who clearly did not want to offer any type of assistance, I asked to speak to someone else (preferably someone I could understand clearly). 

The next person that I reached was yet another man with a very strong Indian accent. His name was Harry and he identified himself as the manager. Finally, he found my reservation in their system but told me that I made the reservation two weeks past the date in which I had reserved the room. I clearly know when I made the reservation for yet this man insisted that I was wrong. Come to find out, Danielle must have incorrectly marked us down in the incorrect date/slot which was a honest mistake. After another 15-20 minutes of being on the phone, Harry squeezed me into another slot on the day in which I had originally  booked the room for. Ahhh finally, it's all taken care of. NOPE! 

Upon opening the email confirmation within minutes of getting off the phone, I find out that the cost of the room which I had booked was now almost DOUBLE the price! I immediately called back and Paul told me that Harry was not available as he was in a meeting. After explaining the situation to Paul (who still did not seem to care to help me whatsoever), I became increasingly frustrated. Paul told me that no one except Harry can change the price back to what I was originally quoted and now instead of being in a meeting, I was told that Harry was gone for the weekend and would not return until after our visit. Clearly, he had lied to me and for some reason; did not want me to speak to Harry. Paul continued to yell at me, speak to me like a piece of trash and told me that he will not do anything to help me resolve this situation. I explained to him that TWO people there at the hotel quoted me a specific price, yet the confirmation I was sent showed a price nearly double. 

Being that this hotel is a subsidiary of a large corporation such as Wyndham, I explained to Paul that I will then call the corporate phone number and explain this situation to them and inform them how unprofessional he has been. His response was ""go ahead and call, I don't care what you do"". Way to keep it classy Microtel front desk guy! 

Now, after another 45 minutes of being on the phone with the customer care representative and explaining the situation once again; I was told that there was nothing they could do to resolve the situation until they investigate it further and get back to me within 4-5 days. Lovely! After being defeated and clearly frustrated, I hung up.

We arrived at the Microtel around 3:00pm the following day and who do I find at the front desk? Yep, Paul. Employee of the Year looking miserable and speaking extremely rude to us and other customers. His face clearly matched the rude voice on the phone. As he proceeded to check us in, I explained who I was and he said ""yeah I remember you and there is nothing I can do"". I noticed another female employee there and upon reading her name tag, I noticed that it was Danielle who I originally spoke to. 

When I asked to speak to her, Paul said ""yeah go over and talk to her"" instead of offering to get Danielle's attention for a customer seeking assistance. So by now, I had to walk outside to track down Danielle who I have never met before. Little did I know, her work shift was over and she was getting ready to leave. I apologized for bothering her and explained who I was and the horrible situation that I have been through. Thankfully she recognized who I was and remembered speaking to me. 

She came back inside the hotel and informed Paul the correct price amount which I was quoted by herself and the manager. She must have needed proper authorization to manually change a price in their computer and made the necessary calls. The whole time, Paul stood there and did not offer to help at all. While Danielle finished checking us in, she apologized for the hassle. 

Had it not been for her, we would have spent nearly twice as much to stay there. Big thanks for her for taking the time to help us when Paul treated us like trash!",2013-06-10 18:29:58,négatif,négatif

Everyone has had bad service occasionally, or once in a while the place is having an off night. This was atrocious and I rarely ever use that word in a public setting. I could see from our table that we weren't the only ones in distress. Read on...

We were seated immediately, and as the server changed television channels to find the futbol game, we were ignored for almost 10 minutes. Both servers walked past our table with little care that we had even been seated, and I can understand if you are slammed and you are behind, but at this point in the evening, we were one of three tables in the entire place. The focus was on the soccer game. Around the 10 minute mark we contemplated leaving, but just as I decided to leave the server asks us for drink orders and if we were ready to order. Sure..., if we had menus.

Once we received our menus, we quickly caught on that we weren't a priority unless we were on television kicking a ball around. We ordered one app (why, I have no idea at this point), and our entrees which took around 50 minutes to arrive. Keep in mind that this is Indy500 weekend, and out-of-towners are slowly pouring into this place looking confused as where to sit, whom to see, or what to do. Almost utter chaos. Our food arrived, and it was very similar to anything you can get here in Atlanta at our chains like El Azteca, El Porton, or the like. Nothing spectacular. Nothing worth waiting over an hour to receive. I ate, because I'm fat, and I need to eat to fuel this chubby frame of mine, regardless of flavor.

Then comes getting the check. Almost 20 minutes after our plates were finished (read: not clean), we get the check. I scramble to find cash because who knows how long it's going to take to get my card swiped. Cash in hand, we escape from this mediocre experience with our sanity and this lovely review for would-be customers.

Again, I absolutely abhor writing these because I know someone's livelihood is affected by what I say. That BEING SAID, this place needs to adjust, staff, adjust some more, and maybe think about turning that giant television off when your livelihood is waiting for a water refill or just to order their dinners.

After having daily (and progressively worse) neck pain for years, I decided to try chiropractic care. Admittedly, I was a bit skeptical about the entire prospect, but Dr. Irby made me feel incredibly comfortable. She first did a thorough evaluation to determine the precise issues I had, and then laid out a comprehensive treatment plan. She took as much time as I needed to answer questions and was upfront about expectations and timetables for improvement. 

 After several weeks of treatment, my neck pain was all but gone. After several months, it was incredible to see the structural improvements in my neck via photos. I had taken several pounds of stress! It is one thing to feel better, but it's another entirely to see proof that the chiropractic care had improved my spinal health.

This truly comes from someone who grew up in the South, with North and South Carolina cuisine in my blood and dining room each and every night.  I have never had a meal at a mainstream, hip, restaurant that claimed to have Soul Food as the menu and actually nailed it.  The Eagle does an exceptional job at providing a well-rounded soul food menu, with several local beers on tap, a great wine list, and desserts.  This place is Hip and Very Good.  It's a really cool combination.

It's all in the Fried Chicken.  Choose from Whole Chicken, 1/2 Chicken, 1/4 Chicken White Meat, or 1/4 Chicken Dark Meat.  

The sides are just amazing, perfectly sized portions, of goodness.  Pick from FRIES (tossed in herbs with a side of aioli), COLLARDS (stewed with ham hocks & bacon), COLE SLAW (creamy & a little tart), SPOONBREAD (iron skillet corn bread with maple butter), SWEET POTATO CROCK (with toasted mini marshmallows), MAC & CHEESE (five cheeses & garlic breadcrumbs), or WHITE CHEDDAR GRITS (with house made pickled peppers).  We tried just about all of them and let me say they really are very delicious.

Salads, Snacks, and Sandwiches are all on the menu too.

Remember, the Beer bottles, Beer cans, Beer on Tap, and Wine selection is pretty great as well.  We just cannot find anything wrong with The Eagle.  It was by far our best meal in Indianapolis during our 4-day stay.

Service too is on point.  Nate is incredible.  He nailed our order exactly right (down to every detail) the first time, checked in regularly with us, had a genuine interest in how everyone at the table was doing, and was just an all-around nice guy.  Thank You Nate!

The decor has an open space area reminiscent of a loft with a monochromatic color palette. Subway tiles accent the walls and columns throughout the space which gives it an upscale terminal/market vibe. Light fixtures are a mix of recess, track, and two styles of industrial wrought iron pendant lights.

An adjoining wine shop with a vast selection of reds & whites from across the globe. As well as specialty tasting olive oil and vinegar bar.

The accompanying condiments of applewood bacon, roma tomatoes and romesco aioli subtly complimented the chicken with sweet and tart flavors fusing together. Mouth FIREWORKS !!!! The homemade chips made me want a whole bag due to the slightly crispy, dark yet lightness. (Reminded me of old school Wise potato chips).

Due to a stuffed tummy, the desserts were packed to go. Macoroons and a marscapone, huckleberry cake. Presentation of the cake in a round shot size glass was special in a simple and ""fru fru"" way.",2014-01-20 20:42:29,positif,positif

I live about 20 miles away so when I come to Eves I usually get between $100 & $200 worth of sandwich's.  If you order hot peppers on your sandwich's they are FREE.  If you ask for 2 small side orders of hot peppers for those who like to put their own peppers on THEY CHARGE YOU $.70 CENTS EXTRA ? BUT IF YOU GET THEM ON THE SANDWICH THEY ARE FREE.  SO TODAY EVEN THOUGHT MY ORDER WAS OVER $120.00 TOTAL, THEY LOST THE SALE OF TWO MORE LARGE ZEPS FOR A TOTAL OF $22.00 BECAUSE THEY WANTED .35 CENTS A CUP FOR PEPPERS ?  Does this make sense to you as a business you would rather lose $22.00 in sandwich's  and charge .70 cents for peppers you would put on for FREE ?????????? I used to spend between $1,800 to $2,200 a year at Eves but in 2017 it will be many trips less over peppers you should get for free!  I ask the cashier who run the business and she told me the kids were. The oldest daughter who took care of my orders for years knew what I spend at their business and always gave a bag of chips or a 2 liter bottle of soda with orders between $100 & $200 dollars and now they can't afford two .35 cents cups of peppers.

If only ""Zero Star"" was an option, that would be undeserving.

My first time getting up, prior to my manicure completion, and just accepting a $10 waste of money.

It was unbelievable!  Not only did the nail tech incompetently perform my service, the unprofessionalism was appalling.

Not only did we sit at a work station without a barrier, but she continued to have a ""speaker phone"" conversation while doing my manicure. If this wasn't rude enough, her male associate brought her a second phone that she temporarily engaged in a second conversation. 

During this ordeal, which lasted long enough to clip my nails, poorly trim my cuticles and bloody my finger, she began to put lotion on my arm without even smoothing my nails with a file.

But this wasn't even the worst part for me. She pulled her mask down to ensure the other party of her conversation could hear her better. This resulted in my turning my head to insulate myself from her mask-less conversation. After a couple minutes, I had to get up. 

With the virus ravaging our way of life, this tech felt it was ok to work without a mask for significant time. Needless to say, ""her business was more important than my business."" She didn't get the hint that her customer's head was turned away. 

She was in disbelief that I didn't want to finish. Unfortunately, I used some regrettable choice words prior to asking her what I owed. I was charged $10 bucks. I was hesitant to pay, but I guess this is how they do business.

I had been a customer for more than 2 years and had fulfilled all of my contract obligations.  When I spoke to a representative about cancelling, he tried to get me to stay by offering me discounted pricing on my monitoring service. I was NOT interested because I had already switched to Ring which offered significantly better hardware (supports multiple keypads) for a fraction of the price of what I was paying with FrontPoint.  Finally after hearing all of the incentives and declining all of them, I was told that I needed to submit in writing a 30 day cancellation notice and was given an email address.  I submitted an email stating my name and the account that I wished to cancel.  A few months went by, and I noticed that my credit card was still being charged even after 30 days from my cancellation notice.  

I called FrontPoint again, but was unable to get a hold of the right person who was needed for this type of situation.  I then decided to cancel my credit card, because FrontPoint does not have a way to remove an active credit card that is associated to a subscription.  No where on FrontPoint's website is there an email address to contact someone for billing or even support.  

After a couple months, I received a call from a FrontPoint representative informing me that my credit card information needed to be updated.  I informed the representative that I had canceled my account months ago and that FrontPoint is no longer authorized to charge my credit card.  The representative stated that he would make a note of this to my file.  After the call, I thought finally I was done with FrontPoint.  A couple weeks went by, and I received an automated phone call from FrontPoint stating that important information needed to be updated to my account.  I have been receiving these annoying calls everyday now for the  past 3 months.  Not sure what to do to get FrontPoint to stop.  

Finally today, a representative called me and stated that I have an outstanding balance.  I corrected him and told him that I cancelled months ago, and that FrontPoint has overcharged my account for the time after I cancelled, and that I was entitled to a refund.  He said he would look into the matter, but I doubt it, and I asked him to cancel my account.

I find it very disappointing that FrontPoint makes it so easy to sign-up, but extremely difficult (if not impossible) to cancel. The fact that FrontPoint has to stoop so low to try to retain a customer makes me feel obligated to warn others about this.",2019-09-13 19:22:16,négatif,négatif

It really killed the excitement we had for this place.

We ended up having to wait so we went to the restaurant section of the theater which was clean. It was a little too dark and I don't know if it was on purpose of their just trying to save on electricity. 

When we entered the theater it was an average movie threaten size but with bigger seats and attached tables. I ordered the nachos as an app with my friend and they were good. The cheese sauce was good but there weren't enough toppings. For an entree I order, pasta and meatballs, and there was an over powering amount of cheese on the meat balls so I didn't eat them. I just ate the pasta. I would recommend not anything with the cilantro. It has a processed taste to it. I didn't know that cilantro could have a processed taste to it until I had that meal.

This was nothing write home about. Average buffet setup with a limited selection. If I had to point out two highlights of the meal, it was the Mango Lassi and the Chicken Curry. Those were probably two of the only things worth consuming. The Naan was unusually dry and broke apart. There were chips of bone inner mixed in the Mutton that someone could have potentially chipped a tooth on if not careful. The fried cheese ball soaked in sugar and honey was beyond sickening sweet. The rice was crunchy, obviously not cooked thoroughly. Most of the cuisine was very heavy on the stomach to the point of nauseous, making for a very uncomfortable rest of the afternoon.  

The quality of service was less than to be desired. Instead of being greeted and lead to our seat when we first arrived, a man came out from the kitchen and pointed to where we were to sit. After disappearing the back for about five minutes, he came out with residue spotted silverware and a pitcher of water. There was no greeting offered, no inquiry if we had been here before. He quickly filled the glasses and left. (Not to mention this would be the LAST time we would get our glasses filled.) We observed our surrounding environment, noticing others who appeared to be regulars helping their selves to the buffet, so we followed suit. 
One of the bullet points on the buffet etiquette list at the beginning of the line was to always take a clean plate if returning to the buffet. Good thing we weren't hungry when we arrived there, because we probably would have created the leaning tower of plates! None of the wait staff returned to collect the dirty dishes, NOR was there a place to leave the dirty ones behind!  When it came time to pay the bill, the gentleman at the front promptly stated the amount.  He took the exact change and said nothing as we thanked him upon leaving. Not even a ""Thank-you""' ""Come back again"" or even, ""Get the hell out"". Nothing. 

Overall rude wait staff and mediocre food provides for a poor dining experience. I'm not sure who in their right mind would nominate them for a readers choice award in both 2004 & 2006. I'm also confused by the 4 and 5 star reviews others have given this place. Perhaps I came on a bad day? Maybe everyone got yelled at in the kitchen before we arrived? Perhaps I wore the wrong color? Who knows! All I can say is I'm convinced I would have had a better dining experience along the side of the Schuylkill Expressway, gagging on exhaust and flying debris than I did here.",2012-09-06 04:08:45,négatif,négatif

It has changed a lot over the years, as it was an absolute dump when I was younger. It has grown and improved greatly since then, expanding now with an outdoor patio.

While it's pricier than what I would've gotten through YMCA's financial aid open doors deal, it's far more convenient-- I basically hop on a bus outside of my apartment and 10-15 minutes later I'm there.  The area is really nice, two great food places are nearby (Mugshots and the Belgian Cafe, which I have yet to try out).  The staff is really friendly overall, though I have my reservations about 2 people (then again, I'm quite the Judgy McJudgerson, they're probably nice people).  It's definitely a small gym, with lots of equipment, but I never really feel crowded and the weight lifting equipment is great.  Bikes and treadmills are fine, but I kind of wish they would fit in a few more treadmills (is it just me, or does it seem like there are too many ellipticals?)  Also, it'd be nice if each treadmill had its own tv, but I digress...
I've been to several yoga classes, usually vinyasa and an intro class on Saturdays, and loved all the instructors so far.  I'm somewhat of a newbie to yoga and in most classes, the instructors walk around and help you on your poses-- I find that really helpful.  Locker rooms are fine, and the built-in lock system sure is handy.  I see a variety of people here, not just all students, which is also nice...everyone seems friendly and courteous.

The few caveats:
They rarely run the fans (why? I should probably ask).
Hearing ""gym music"" (you know, uplifting pop stuff) while cooling down in yoga is kind of a distraction, but I guess it can't really be helped.
No A/C that I can speak of, which does get annoying.

The service is still spotty, but the last time was particularly good, with a knowledgeable and pleasant waitress getting us samples before committing to a pint of something new. NO COVERS ANYMORE! And a few times they had pretty good bands (70 year old soul singer, rockabilly...). The overgrown frattys are still there, but are so much more tolerable when they can't smoke cigars. Makes for good people watching though!

Parking still sucks. Especially when there's an event downtown and the lot behind the bar goes to prepay rather than allowing you to get it validated inside. There isn't a lot of street parking in the area. I'm sure it's still really crowded on Mondays, and for Trivia nights (when we played here we used to have to get there 2 hours before the game to get a table).

Yay improvement!",2012-02-08 23:17:16,neutre,neutre

You need a reservation right now, they are not taking walk ins. Free parking right behind their restaurant where it says customer parking only.

We made a reservation for the omakase shogun with the sake pairing. I was honestly SO full from this meal. My husband had to help me finish my food and sake lol. Each dish was amazing and plated beautifully. 

Arte explained each sake that was paired with the dishes. He was fun and energetic throughout our meal. Chef Rexley explained where the fish from the dishes came from as well as explained to us the other non fish dishes. This was our first time having uni and it was so good! There was also another chef/assistant? that prepared some of our dishes and he was great too (sorry didn't catch his name!).

However, my spinal health took a recent turn for the worse and I was even less enthusiastic about going to an orthopedist and having them tell me that surgery was my only option.

My woes began back in October when I was involved in a hit and run accident while riding my motorcycle.  Although I was lucky to be alive and did not suffer life threatening injuries, I ""tweaked"" a lot of body parts, including my back.  Things got a little better but I recently spent an entire day pulling up cement forms from a recent home improvement project.  I could feel my back was stiff but I attributed it to a hard days work.  However, when I woke up the next morning, I could not even put on my own socks due to the immense pain in my back.

At the recommendation of a coworker (thanks Richard), I immediately called Dr. Ryan Russo at the Lakeview Regional Chiropractic Clinic in Lakeview.  Even though it was a Friday and he was going out of town that evening, he agreed to see me.  On my first visit, we discussed my issues, he took some x-rays and discussed some treatment options.  He did not adjust me on my first visit, as he needed to see the x-rays first to make a proper diagnosis.  I iced up that weekend as per his instructions and came back on Monday to begin my treatments.

It was difficult for me to relax for my first adjustment, but Dr. Russo told me everything he was going to do, prior to him doing it so that there would be no surprises.  I have been going for approximately three weeks now and have made significant strides towards getting back to my old self.

Dr. Russo is a ""younger"" chiropractor (30something) and is interested in treating the cause of back problems and not just ""chasing pain"".  His mission, as qutoed on his website, is ""To restore and maintain health through chiropractic care, allowing patients to live their lives to the fullest"". He also states on his website that ""We're committed to putting your health first by finding the cause of your problem rather than chasing the symptom"".

I am a firm believer in him and his clinic, and he practices what he preaches about good health, which is also a big part of good chiropractic health.  I have learned a lot from him about anti-inflammatory supplements and foods that will help improve my spinal health.  He doesn't ""push"" these supplements on his customers, and actually does not even sell them, so they is no pressure to buy anything.

When we arrived we got our bracelets and were told to sit at the bar until a crowd or line formed. Punch Line has a two drink minimum. It's required once you are in the showroom. -- Although I knew about the minimum, I didn't realize it was only in the showroom. So I ordered a beer out by the bar thinking it would contribute to that. My fault. We also decided to order an app because we were starving. We ordered the margherita pizza. It was pretty good! The crust was so flakey making a mess everywhere though.

Once it was time to form for the meet and greet, they had a line literally wrapping around the outside of the building. Things went pretty fast which was nice. The staff was definitely efficient in getting everyone in and out. When entering the showroom someone will guide you to your seats. Our table was directly, front row and center of the stage. What luck!

Once I was informed that our outdoor drink didn't contribute we were talked into ordering the larger margarita because it would count as two drinks and we would be hitting our minimum. It was $48 for two margaritas (ridiculous) -- not to mention it tasted like juice. Made our stomachs hurt quite a bit after too. 

Three stars for the staff / out door bartender / pizza. I definitely would come back for another show, but Punch Line is just your typical comedy club. Nothing out of this world.",2017-10-19 18:10:57,neutre,neutre

Right below the Corner Wine Bar, unmarked like a speakeasy, the Wellington appeals to a pretty casual, mature crowd. Just follow the rabbit hole...

Before I was married, my crew would go here for the comfortable atmosphere. This is not your typical Broad Ripple bar. If you want to avoid the bar hoppers and club crawlers, then you're in the right place. On the weekends, be prepared for a crowded room. The downstairs is VERY small, and only holds a few tables.

Minutes after I left the business after picking up my car, i noticed a pocket knife missing. I always keep it in the change compartment and saw it there when I dropped off my car (i specifically checked). I asked if i needed to remove my valuables prior and was assured that only the manager empties valuables. When I called to report my knife not returned in my box of belongings, i was told that there is no way it was in the car. I am not accustomed to being called a liar but i was not up for the fight so i let it go. Until the next day when my carpets were dry and i was putting my mats back in place i noticed one mat missing. I called again and they couldn't find it. They sent a picture of a mat by text message. Since i could not tell easily, i had to drive out of my way to find it was the wrong size and color although it was from a Honda. it seems as if this is standard practice and they have a surplus of unclaimed mats! I was flabbergasted at this point. I was basically called a liar when i called to report my pocket knife missing and now they can't find my mat. i was promised that they would order a new one which is not possible since these are carpet colored and come with the car, he offered to get a new set of mats from the dealer and replace all of them. I thought it was too much but he assured me it wasn't a big deal since they do alot of business with the dealerships. a week later, i recieve a text that they have my mat. i again drive out of my way and could not believe that there was no new set of mats as promised. They did find the same color and size mat as the missing one however this one had cigarette burns (not only am i not a smoker, but no one has ever smoked in my car so this was obviously NOT my mat). He took the mat over to one of the guys who did something and the burn was not so obvious (i can't be sure but it looks like the cigarette burn was cut out). he asked me if i was pleased. of course i wasn't but after numerous phone calls and trips out of my way, i was so fed up i wanted to be done with them. he offered me a detail on the house but i said i couldn't take the chance that anything else would be missing from my car. no remorse for all my trouble and no apology. he basically shrugged when i said no thank you.  BTW - the pocket knife miraculously showed up too. I can only assume that the ""manager"" who empties valuables from the car missed this compartment, one of the detailers found my knife and assumed he was in the clear. What really annoys me is that they would not even consider that i was telling the truth without ever asking their employees if they ""found"" a knife. I gave them a way out but they chose not to take it.

Long story short...don't use this business...The owner either doesn't care or doesn't know what a bunch of idiots and thieves he has employed. they did a good job on my car but the aggravation was not worth it.
Maybe the owner should not have his ""manager"" handle customer satisfaction.",2012-06-17 22:45:36,négatif,négatif

Last Friday evening around 5:30, I boarded a westbound train with two other people. The train car was surprisingly empty, but I made a mad dash for the only seat that had a sports page sitting on it. Just as I started to get into the Flyers' injury updates, the lights went out. This seemed odd, but the train was still moving so I didn't think much of it. 

We went underground in Camden, and the darkness in the tunnels was quite spooky. As we approached the first underground station, the train slowed, but did not stop. Same with the second. So the lights were out, we weren't making stops and no announcements were being made. As we made our way out of the tunnel and onto the Ben Franklin Bridge, I text-messaged my sister about the situation and said that I was a little freaked. 

As we went back underground in Philly, I thought we would surely stop at 8th and Market, where I was supposed to get off the train. Again, the train slowed but did not stop. At this point, it is safe to say-- I WAS LOSING MY SHIT!!! Worst-case scenarios featuring gunmen and hostage situations filled my head. 

I abandoned the sports section and made my way closer to the other passengers. A lovely woman by the name of Susan comforted me when I expressed my concern for our safety. For that, I am eternally grateful. 

When the train started slowing to what appeared to be a stop as we got to the 12th/13th & Locust station, I stood up and announced that I was going to pry the doors open with my bare hands if I had to. Which is exactly what I tried to do-- only, the doors were locked. I felt like I was in a horror movie when suddenly, the lights went on and we could see the conductor walking towards us from the car in front of us, a confused look on his face. He opened the door and said, ""this train is out of service!"" To which all three of us replied (i.e., screamed) something along the lines of ""well then why were we let on to begin with?!"" peppered with many expletives (mostly mine). 

I shakily made my way above ground, grateful to be alive, grateful for the kindness of strangers and grateful that some taxi drivers don't mind driving drunk girls home to Jersey at the end of the night when they decide to pass on the train.",2009-02-11 21:21:19,négatif,négatif

The food is just average, however. I wouldn't say there's much authenticity at all to the so-called Cuban food on the menu. Every dish I've tried is pretty bland, could definitely use some more seasoning (the rice and beans is literally just that, plain rice and plain beans). The food is also overpriced for what it is ($15 for black beans and tortilla chips...).

The problem was with the financing dept. Initially we purchased the extended warranty program that they offered. However after a week we elected to drop the warranty. We contacted the dealership and attempted to cancel our original warranty. We could NOT get the finance person (Ryan Erdle) to return phone calls or answer emails. I had to go to the dealership to find another finance person to make the cancellation. All good now, right? Wrong.

This all took place in August of 2015. I had to contact Honda USA to intervene on my behalf in order to get the Ryan Erdle to cancel the warranty. This alone took over one month of Honda USA calling the dealership to do the right thing. 

There was always an excuse. But finally It was submitted, and hopefully in 3-4 weeks something positive will happen. It is now December 2015. 4 months later.

My recommendation is if you use Palm Harbor Honda do not use Ryan Erdle as your finance person.",2015-12-16 21:52:39,négatif,négatif

1.  It is CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN
2.  The staff is amazingly warm and welcoming
3. The beds are properly cared for; they regularly (read: often) replace the bulbs to ensure maximum efficacy of the beds. 

I wanted to write a review for European Sun because it is not often that you find such a lovely place to tan.  It is by far one of the cleanest tanning places I've ever been to.  I have watched the staff clean the beds and they put some serious energy into ensuring the beds and the rooms are properly cleaned.  Also, it is truly a pleasure to visit European Sun.  Every person that works here is kind and friendly and acts genuinely happy to have you there.  When you walk in you always get a friendly ""Hello"" and I've never left without someone telling me ""Thank you"" and/or ""Have a nice day.""  It is wonderful to visit a business that seems genuinely happy to have you as a customer.  I believe the staff is so friendly because the owner sets the tone for the business. The owner herself is genuine, kind and truly wants you to have a good experience.  Her efforts pay off with the incredible cleanness of the rooms and the friendliness of the staff.  Finally, it is important to note that the beds are very well cared for.  The bulbs are regularly (often) changed to ensure you get the maximum experience.

I would say the Bindi is definitely stand out and I really like what they have done with the fusion menu. Sure its pricey but given the quality and thought that has gone into the unique selection of dishes I would say it's worth every cent. For two of us we spent about $100 without tip for starters, entrees and 1 desert. We brought a long a bottle of Rum (its BYOB) and they served us a very nice mixer (mango sharbat). We should have gone for the nimbu-pani (Indian style pomegranate-ginger lemonade) which was what the waitress recommended. The mango mixer was very nice but after a while was a bit sweet and sickly .... well she did warn us. I have never come across this before and its a nice concept. High quality cocktails but for a very reasonable price. 

The service is good and the decor modern and stylish. Location great. It's cash only but no problem, there is an ATM at the pizza joint two doors down. The food was yummy and very well cooked. I started with the ghee poached lobster pani puri which was very different to usual puri. The puri was made into 5 tasty little parcels, very unique. My Wife had the sindhi eggplant a gorgeous little vegetarian curry. Entree follow ups were just as good. I had the lamb two ways and the lamb was cooked to perfection and full of great flavors. My wife had the seafood goozoo which was kind of like and Indian Gumbo. Very tasty, but not as good as the lamb. Which was stand out. For desert I had the vanilla bean panna cotta. Very nice. All in all great, only comment would be everything is a touch over-salted.

The hostess greeted us, sat us instantly and was very friendly. The waitress was efficient and a sweetheart. Everything came out correctly in a timely fashion (which is unusual at this place in my past experiences) and she always had a smile on her face. 

The food was mediocre. I ordered the sliders. They claim to come with a sauce, but I didn't see any at all. Not even on the bottom of the bun. The sliders looked like they made one burger and sliced it with a blindfold on. One of the sliders were gigantic and the bottom of the bun was a tiny morsel of bread. Another slider was the opposite, the burger was tiny and the bun was huge. It was evident the cook didn't give a crap. If it were a Saturday night dinner rush and the kitchen was slammed, I would let it slide. (No pun intended) This was a Wednesday night and the dining room was about a quarter full. 

Another thing, my menu was disgusting. It was sticky and covered in some sort of substance. I'm assuming a customer previously ate with it on the table and spilled something on it. It was so gross that I quickly decided on an entree just so I wouldn't have to look through the menu anymore. 

The drinks we ordered during dinner were delicious and cheaper than what I remembered. The games were the highlight.

The bar was not that busy and I have received faster service when they've had a full bar. Finally when one of the bartenders (older blonde woman) acknowledged us we ordered waters. Normally I tip a dollar when I order just a water from the bar because it's free and they are still doing me a service. The woman looked at us as if we were a burden to her and continued what she was doing. A minute or two later she proceeds to use the cups to scoop out the ice. Working in the business myself I know that this is a no-no whether it's plastic or glass. We decided against not ordering any alcoholic drinks due to poor service and the fear of cutting my mouth with a piece of glass.

I grew up eating Italias food and truly missed it when I moved away. When I moved back, I was happy to know that I would have a great pizza place to order my favorites from again. Last week I treated myself and ordered the Chicken Francaise, a $17.00 dinner with delivery, but I argue to myself that it is worth it because you get two huge pieces of chicken and some pasta. Once again it's expensive, but I feel worth it because I also have lunch for the next day.  My husband orders me food once a week because I'm unable to cook on this day. Today, my husband ordered ordered the same thing and tipped the driver $5 because ""He didn't have change"" which I didn't mind at that point because I was excited about my meal. When I opened the container there was only one large piece of chicken. I've never called and complained about other mistakes, but for a $22 meal I felt like I was robbed. A woman answered and I explained the situation to which she said that the piece of chicken was the same size of two pieces. I explained to her that that was not the case. She then became a little snarky and told me that I was given one piece because they pounded it out and made it bigger. I can assure you that the one piece is the same size of one piece from last week. I was taken back by her behavior and responded ""That's your answer?"" To which case she hung up on me. I've worked in the industry and people want consistency, to be treated with respect and to get what they pay for. It is unfortunate that we will be shopping for a place that can fulfill these basic requirements. I can say that we will miss there food, but can't be concerned about poor accountability.

I am a novice gardener and have been there several times in the last few months while starting an indoor herb and succulent garden.  There is an older woman in the greenhouse that has a rough attitude and does her best to ignore you. I explained to her that I was starting a garden for the first time and had a few questions about plant selection and care. Her answers were short and I ended up researching my questions online. 

The second time I went to pick up a gardenia. I went outside to their flower section and asked a male employee if he could show me where they were. He told me to look in the greenhouse. After a 15 minute search, I still couldn't locate the plant. I went to the register and the same employee was there. When I asked if he could show me specifically where the gardenia was, he looked annoyed and said ""oh, well now that I think of it, we don't have any"". It seemed more like he just didn't want to take the time to show me. 

The woman working the register took my name and said she would order the plant. The next day I got a call from the rough lady from greenhouse who said they had had the plant yesterday and said I just didn't know where to look. 

After having the plant for a week, all of the buds and a few leaves  turned yellow and dropped off. I called to ask if I was doing something wrong and was told that I needed to give it more water. The person I spoke with said if that didn't work, then I could exchange the plant. Watering made the problem worse, and I soon noticed gnats. The gnats started affecting all of my other plants. 

I called a second time and was told to bring the plant in to exchange it. Again, the greenhouse lady was not friendly and simply told me that the plant had a lot of problems. She suggested neem oil to help with the pests. I asked if could exchange it as I was told I could, and she told me no, that's not the policy. 

If you are an experienced gardener and need no assistance - this might be a great option for your plant needs. Otherwise, AVOID!",2015-05-05 22:55:36,négatif,négatif

I tried the Tavern Burger as it had been recommended to me so many times. The ""meltaway"" bun was the highlight, but everything else fell flat. The meat had a strange (to me) taste that I couldn't quite put my finger on. It may have been the rib eye/filet beef mix, but as I like both of those cuts I have a hard time believing that was the culprit. I couldn't even finish it, which as a burger lover is extremely rare.

The side of fries were relatively standard yet plentiful.

The service was okay. I would have expected better from an upscale restaurant, but it was sufficient. The atmosphere inside the restaurant was great -- definitely my favorite part of the meal.

I'm certainly willing to give Tavern another chance, but I'll go for something other than the burger.",2017-07-30 23:31:23,neutre,neutre

This particular store consistently runs a substandard operation--from the seemingly high-turnover staff to the poorly prepared food (freshness is always in question).

I have loved Arby's food all my life. I have lived in Catalina for just over 2 years. My takeout experiences here are generally horrible. I could just stop eating there...but like I've already said, I love Arby's and I have a right to good service. Other Arby's stores in town provide a good eating experience; why can't this one? The owner of this store should be practicing the same level of customer service and quality.

Now, on to tonight's experience...first off, I have since stopped ordering through drive-thru because their error rate for me is well over 75%; these days, I just go into the store for take out so I can ensure my order is correct right there on premises. My wife doesn't grab us takeout often, but tonight she did and they got her order wrong (big shock), they didn't know the special they were running (2-for-$5 fish sandwiches) and the food brought home (a 5 minute drive, mind you) was practically inedible; my fish tasted like it had sat under the heat lamp for an hour.

I've been to some places througout the SF Bay area who ""claim"" to be sushi restaurants, who serve plain crap that a true sushi chef from Japan wouldn't dare serve.  

Granted that Reno is in the middle of the desert so I wasn't expecting the fish to be freshly plucked from the ocean, plus it was for an all you can eat special, so I knew the bulk of the stuff had to be frozen. I came in with the preconcieved notion that it wasn't going to be that good. I was pleasantly surprised. 

We opted for the all you can eat sashimi for $33. We didn't bother with the all you can sushi, even if it was $10 cheaper. C'mon folks you're not here to fill yourself up with rice and maki-rolls! Go for the good stuff. And go for the good stuff we did - unagi, ikura, tobiko, hotate, tako, ika, hamachi, tai, maguro, ebi, amaebi. We skipped the cheap stuff and dove straight in for the high ticket items. I think the restaurant  may have broken even with us. They ran out of tako and ika, and I saw they were running low on amaebi.  It was actually pretty good, considering it used to be, flash frozen fish.

It's a tequila bar, and as such has an amazing varieties of tequila to choose from, more than anyone in town.  The wall behind the bar goes from floor to ceiling housing tequila varieties of all kinds.  It's kinda cool watching the bartender climb a ladder to reach the type you've chosen to drink.  That being said it's confusing to me how when you go here, a tequila bar, the majority of the patrons are drinking bottles of Miller Light.  I mean don't you go to a tequila bar for tequila?  Some of their options can get pretty expensive as most high end tequila tends to be pretty pricey.

The place looks and sounds like a dance party more than a bar, and it tends to be the same group of people that hang out here every night.  They offer a limited menu, with a few appetizer type snacks.  The coolest thing they offer are tequila 'flights' and I highly recommend them.  You pick a different number of tequilas (the price varies depending on how many you choose)  and they're served in shot glasses which are situated in a piece of wood.  The flight comes with homemade lime-sicles which you use to taste the tequila.  Instead of just drinking the shots, you dip your lime-sicle into the tequila and drink it that way.  Its a great way to really taste the different flavors of the tequila, plus its just a unique gimmick.  This is definitely a bar and not a place to go for dinner.  If you like tequila, or just want a different kind of bar to go to give this place a try.

I loved that they kept the original historic windows and decor as it is located in Historic Ybor City. You can find street parking across the street for a price, use hotel valet, garage parking or just find free street parking. Also, for out of towners beware that during events like Gasparilla there is just a flat rate for parking (excluding free street parking & valet). The hotel is located right near the main garage for 7th ave. The restaurant is on the 1st level, open space, a place for live music, there is also a cafe off to the right when you enter. 

The restaurant is pretty much the standard hotel restaurant space, but they have a small atrium which overlooks the pool and it lets in a lot of nice natural light. The first time we visited was when they first opened and service was 5 stars. Our waiter was friendly, attentive, and checked everything to see what was gluten free (I am a Celiac). My top recommendation is the ceviche, to be specific the le Tigre ceviche, its amazing! I have had it at other restaurants and this is the best I have ever had. The Chef's sausage trio would be next, 2 out three of the sausages are gluten free. Next, the Painkiller is a must have, the drink comes in an elaborate carafe shaped like a bird and its quite delicious. 

So, our next visit was not the same level of excitement, experience, or service. Our waitress messed up our order and somehow thought it made sense to blame me so my entree came out first and my starter came out with my husbands entree. I lost my appetite because after I asked for them to bring the salad like I originally asked they still brought it out with my husbands steak about half an hour later. She basically said I wasn't being clear about what I wanted and was like ""whatever it isn't my fault"". We had two completely different experiences months apart! It sucks because I ordered the steamed mussels and they tasted amazing when they were hot, but it basically sat on the table and got cold while I was waiting for the salad I originally ordered!!!!! I boxed up my salad to go because they brought it out at the end of dinner and it was soggy by the time I got home. I don't understand why she didn't just have them bring the items out as I ordered them once it became clear my entree came out as an appetizer.

 Overall, the food is five stars, although the menu is small they have some very nice options especially for Celiacs and I did not get sick eating here the items they said were gluten free were gluten free (I basically stuck to seafood and salad.. The live music was also great the time we visited and it was going on. We had a reservation both times and were seated promptly.

Now the review for Cycle Springs Powersports.


Well this is a 50/50 review. I bought two bikes and both were ""good deals"" but just the lies that was told really sealed the deal and made me realize what a mistake I made dealing with this company. 

First review is for my Spyder. Things went so smooth and I didn't feel deceived till the helmet I ordered was to small and the parts guy said well to exchange you will have to pay the difference (which the helmets had same price) I was like they are the same cost. He was thinking they would return it as what they paid then charge me msrp for the new one. What twisted thinking they had. Then on the second bike they told me parts and accessories ""at cost"" I made a list of things I wanted (around $530) and he said I can save you $90. Part of this cost was to replace the pitted brake and clutch lever that can with the ""brand new bike"". I said that's not much of a savings. Then it was no longer ""at cost"" now it turned into ""employee cost"". So you are telling me you make money off your employees for the parts that they order? Any way, then my wife is supposed to be tax exempt and they said they would honor that and then the next day after he realized I had a problem with the ""at cost"" he changed the deal to where they couldn't make it tax exempt. Then I was to be added to the registration and once again they couldn't figure that out either. We did not recieve the owners manual for the bike. They had some kind of story that they could not give us a warranty nor the owners manual because they bought the bike from another dealer. Makes me wonder what else did I not recieve that I was supposed to get with the ""new bike"". I guess they think we should be happy with 2 keys. The owner called me and said he wanted to cancel the deal after my wife had already made a decision and deposit. Just a word to the wise if it's set in stone on ink take it and make the most of it but if not RUN FAST. I was also told gas is just under 1/4 cause if we put any more we would have to charge you more for the bike. You can tell it's money over customer satisfaction cause that was a douche move. I have added pictures of the levers taken day of delivery to show how much they really ""care"" that you get a quality bike and a fair deal.",2017-05-17 21:36:08,négatif,négatif

The meal started out fine with a bowl of tomato-fennel soup which I found very tasty. Then things went downhill fast. My wife and I both ordered the double 5oz burger which we asked for as rare as they would make them. Both burgers came out well done- and the meat may as well have been from Burger King. I think that I would have enjoyed a Whopper more than this burger. When presented the bill, we showed our waitress the Groupon which we had downloaded. She had no idea how to deal with it. After 10 minutes of trying to figure out how to discount our meal with the Groupon, we were told that no one knew how to use it, the owner was away and he's the only one who knew, and then we were told that they only accepted Groupons for lunch- all of which sounded like BS. So we paid full price- never to go back. Oh, and if you're sensitive to mold, stay away. You can still smell the faint odor of mold remaining from pre-construction, thus the use of fans in the dining area.",2019-08-23 13:29:37,négatif,négatif

Since it's located in a somewhat dodgy area of the French Quarter (the next block up is the projects) coming here at night seemed a bit scary, so we came here during the day around 2pm for a few cocktails. Bonus: their happy hour also runs from noon to 8pm. Daily $5 drink specials from noon to 5 every day is an extra bonus!

Our bartender Adrian was super friendly and helpful. I originally asked for a Ramos Gin Fizz, but she was out of eggs at the time, so I went with the 'Tru Kick': Tru Organic Gin, house made ginger syrup, lemon juice, lime juice & Fee. Bros. Peach Bitters. Delicious and refreshing.

Just as we were about to close our tab, the eggs arrived! Adrian graciously offered to make me one to go, as I had mentioned how much I wanted to try one given that it's a ""New Orleans Original"". Only in New Orleans can you get a perfectly frothy Ramos Gin Fizz to go. I love this city! And this bar!

I went to Valère spa yesterday to get a brazilian wax while visiting Boise, I had actually been here once before for a massage a year ago but hadn't put two and two together (the massage was underwhelming to say the least). There's only one woman here that does the waxing, I believe her name is Brittany -- I'm sorry Brittany to be throwing you under the bust like this -- but it was by far the worst waxing experience I have ever had. Already a super unpleasant task to have to do, but this was another level of pain. I told her the wax was too hot, she didn't change the temperature, I continued to wince at the heat and she said ""I think you're psyching yourself out"". K. 

I left, didn't think much of it other than I won't be returning.

This morning I woke up to black and blue bruises and burns all over the area. Not even like a casual bruising because I was tensing my muscles, but full on black, terrifying bruise.

It's unacceptable for this establishment to think this is okay, and I hope they re-evaluate before they move forward giving any further waxes. Valére has you sign a waver before you get waxed basically saying reactions to the waxing process aren't they're fault, however I believe physical bruising and burning very much is.",2017-09-30 17:15:52,négatif,négatif

Atmosphere was great and we got seated immediately (great timing as we were a group of seven and there was room for us, got pretty crowded after we sat). The menu was hard to choose from, because everything looked so good! But I knew what I had to get, Chicken & Waffles! We all ordered up, it took about 30 minutes for everything to come out together which felt like just the right amount of time for fresh cooked food to be prepped during a morning rush. The food was 10/10. Chicken tenders were perfectly crispy but nice and juicy on the inside. The waffle was made out of sweet potato which I had never heard of before and tasted out of this world. It came with a bbq sauce on the side which almost tasted like a zesty ketchup but was REALLY good. That paired with some syrup and crystal (hot sauce) was everything I was looking for. On top of that, it was a decently large sized portion but felt very light to eat. 

Everyone else's food was 10/10 as well. Our waitress (didn't catch her name but she was a tall blonde with a pony tail and buzz fade on the sides) recommended we get coffee with... home made bailey's someone at the restaurant made. I got OJ but took a sip (and a whiff) of someone else's coffee. First off.. that smell though.. pure ecstasy. The taste, it was a real full-bodied subtle bailey's.

I have been here twice. Both times I ordered the M2 Package ($31 plus taxes). The second time I added the Floor Mat Cleaning for $10 additional. 

On my first visit here I ended up having to clean my windows, wheels, vacuum, and clean the bumper. Finally, they sent three guys over to help me work on my car. I ended up being the project manager. Nice.

First visit, $34 plus change, 45 minute wait 20 minutes of my own labor. Clean car.

On my second visit here I had to clean the wheels, the wheel-wells, and windshield. They did not even pretend to wipe down the dash, console, or clean interior of the windshield. They told me my car was ready and my floor mats were not even installed. This is a bad deal for $44 plus change. 

Second visit, $44 plus change, 50 minute wait, and 15 minutes of my own labor, and then returned for 20 minutes for cleaning and talk with owner. Very frustrating for an hour an half and $44. Even after showing the owner popcorn in my car, it's still in the car with me.

One of the managers explained to me that Saturdays are staffed with temp workers. He said if I really want to clean car, come during the week when the staff are true employees.

Tagliatelle al profumo di bosco - wild musrooms in a cream sauce. So, the menu said it was also supposed to have fresh diced tomatoes, but mine came with none.

I sincerely hope that it was merely a result of the restaurant being sparsely occupied during my earlier visit, as opposed to being jam packed on Friday evening.  The difference though was most probably due to my choice of menu items.  For my lunch visit I had a chef salad which included all fresh ingredients that required very little preparation.  For my Friday evening meal, I had grilled shrimp with side orders of parsley potatoes and carrot soufflé.  The Friday meal of course required cooking and it just wasn't prepared very well.

We ordered two bottled beers, 1/2 dozen of oysters on the 1/2 shell and 1/2 dozen of char-grilled oysters.  Both oyster options were great and we polished them off in no time flat.  However, due to the large number of patrons on hand, we waited quite a while for our entrées to arrive, so that by the time they finally arrived, I was not about to send mine's back to have it redone correctly.  Instead, I accepted a meager amount of shrimp in the middle of a large dinner platter, with some sort of dark brown sauce decoratively drizzled over the open spaces of the platter.  On one end of the platter was a scoop of carrot soufflé and on the other end of the platter was a serving spoon of parsley potatoes.  Worse yet, the grilled shrimp were overcooked with the tails still on, and I had to chew the shrimp out of the shells because I was not able to pull the overcooked shrimp out of the shells.

I have never been a person who would just go somewhere and order a salad but this place is really as good as it gets.  Fairly long lines during lunch but they move sooooo quick that you can still get in and out in a decent amount of time.  They are super efficient.

I like trying a lot of the seasonal salads.  I've had the strawberry fields salad with shrimp which is a summer salad that originally had me hooked to this place.  I can't wait for summer to get it again.  I got it three times in one week.  

There's another seasonal salad called the fall house salad which has apples and cranberries.  I can't recall the name of the pear salad that I had recently but it was good also.  You can pick if you want light, medium or heavy dressing.

I highly recommend anything lol but enjoyed each of these:
BBQ chicken wrap
Taco truck wrap
Thai shrimp peanut wrap
Too many salads to even name

Don't forget the chocolate Oreo cookies at the register.....DELISH!

I love this place.  I feel like I need a punch card to get something off after the 10th salad because I've far exceeded that.  The salads are extremely filling and worth the price.  Always nice people.  I'm definitely a fan!",2015-12-22 18:30:09,positif,positif

Our table was next to the counter, she leaned over the counter completely to put our drinks on our table and pushed them closer to us with little nudges from her finger tips. Um okay. She did the same with one of our dishes, we just grabbed it from her. 

Anyway, the food was pretty good. My boyfriend didn't like that the pancakes were made with corn, but I thought they were very good.  His sandwich was huge... I didn't taste it, but he sure enjoyed it. The order came with 5 and I barely ate 2.  They were huge and very fluffy, I was going to definitely take the remainder home.  One of my pancakes ended up not being fully cooked on the inside and an older lady who worked there was so furious that that had happened. I wasn't even mad...  She apologized and INSISTED I give the plate back so she could give me a new order.  I said it was alright cause I was full, but she wouldn't take no for an answer.  Another young gentleman, came over to apologize as well.  She complained to the cook, took it off my bill and packed me up 5 new yummy pancakes to ""have for breakfast tomorrow.""  Unnecessary, but still nice! (I enjoyed every single one of those for lunch, dinner and breakast the next day.)

I would give this place 3 stars, but didn't because sometimes people have bad days.

3. Great ac during summer. Other breweries are definitely too hot to frequent in summer temperatures. 
4. Bring your own cake or decorations for parties! They put my cake in the fridge while we ate.

Some of that newfangled technology (infrared paper towel dispenser, automatic faucet, etc.) would also be welcome in the restroom.

UPDATE - After a bit of pondering, I've decided to take away a star based on my recollection of 'the fly problem'.

the service is what you would expect from a short order take home pizza place. mostly teenagers, but they have always been quick and nice so no complaints here.

For example, there's a poker pay table ""10/7 Double Bonus Poker."" that, if played perfectly, returns 100.7% of your money. Since casinos rarely like to lose money, it's extremely rare to run across. I found it at Western Village, on the 50-play machines. And they weren't even advertising it - they just slipped it in.

Sadly, I guess too many people caught on, and they eventually reduced it to 9/6/5 - which is still an almost 98-percent payback. Good enough that you really don't need to walk in expecting to lose.

Same goes for the tables - you're usually going to find pretty much the least restrictive rules that you can find in a Nevada casino.

I went in and told the place I'd like a pedi and nail fill and they did quickly seat me. They didn't ask which pedicure I wanted, so they did their own thing, which was actually fine but had I wanted something different and was preoccupied or something, (sometimes I'm making appointments on my phone as I get my toes done), I would've been upset. They did a good job with them, but my right big toenail broke in 3 days, and that was with gel polish on. So, I was a little upset about that. 
Then, moving onto the nails. They could tell I was wearing pink & white so they had the products used for that, but didn't ask me what shade of pink I wanted, didn't ask me if I wanted my nails cut down, and they shaped them how they wanted them. I had to speak up and tell them to cut them down and shape them the way I wanted and he didn't seem too excited about a customer telling him what they wanted. :-/ the guy was gentle, and did a good job which is always good in my book. I am going back and I will do another update when I do.

 Update:: I went back today (previous review was from Oct 2021). The owner (I guess he's the owner since he does all the calls), was super friendly and in a great mood. I walked in and told him I wanted a pedi and my pink and white nails to be switched to gel polish. He didn't have any problems with it at all. So, I had my pedi done and the girl who did them was very quiet and didn't speak a word...that's fine. I don't mind a quiet person because I'm one who actually doesn't talk much (believe it!) she did good but I assume I either didn't have any ingrown nails or she didn't dig them out - one or the other..:but she was gentle and it was putting me to sleep lol. 

Onto the nails. The girl was ok...not the best but also not the worst.  She did good about not hurting me, she asked me if I wanted square nails and I said yes but they're square rounded. I don't like that. She tried to haggle me into getting dip power, and I don't like dip powder and at first she wasn't taking no for an answer, but she might've picked up on my annoyance and stopped.

Called the bank and had the extra charges removed.  We will never come back to this place. EVER.

I've been going there for a long time and most of the time I order the chop salad the larger one in fact. The last few times that I went there I bought the larger salad as always but the bowl was only half filled or should I say half empty. I spoke to the manager I was told that everything is methodically measured per corporate guidelines and that's that. Meanwhile before I ordered there's a sample of the bowls where you place your order a large and a small empty bowl at the top of inside of the bowl there is a blue line. Who knew that this blue line was just a decoration and certainly not a measurement as it appears. Again I had always gotten the full ball and always been happy with it but for $10 I expect more than a half a bowl. I'm a full grown man I weigh over 200 pounds and this delicate salad just doesn't cut the mustard. Again the food definitely tastes good and maybe it's just the salads that are a problem. The people that I went with had sandwiches and they were very happy with them they looked good I'm sure they tasted good this review is about portion I feel that if you're going to spend $10 you should get $10 worth of food and again I'm one of those people that orders the same thing all the time and I had an expectation of a full Bowl and was extremely disappointed.

corporate they were nice enough to send me back a letter with a $10 coupon and told me that they planned on speaking with this particular restaurant the one in Bala Cynwyd and I was happy about that until I called tonight to find out about volume and again everyone there has been nice I spoke with a young man who apparently was the manager this time when I was in the shop last time it was a woman but he told me the same thing that again it's all measured so if you're going to go there I think you can expect good tasting food just don't order the salad it ain't worth $10.",2017-07-21 22:26:35,neutre,négatif

Full disclaimer: eating an entirely vegetarian meal (as a meat eater) is entirely fine by me. That said, my very much meat eating boyfriend is enamored with this place! We tried it out last week and then came back again yesterday! So far we had the Philly steak (twice - the best item in my opinion), the ziggy burger (delicious smoky flavor) and the curry tofu wrap (maybe a little mushy as far as texture but super tasty!). 

Seeing other people's pics of the burger and sandwiches, I was a little hesitant. I thought the bun looked hard and too bready. I was wrong! There is enough sauce on the sandwich and just general delicious juiciness that I didn't expect from a veggie burger that the bread is perfect to stand up to all of it. Definitely our new go-to spot! 

One note though, I would never pay $4 for a whipped banana. I often freeze bananas and blend them at home. It's a delicious treat (tastes like ice cream!) but that price is obscene. Buy a 19 cent banana from trader joes and do it yourself!",2016-06-23 13:53:14,positif,positif

I dropped off a few suits mid July to get altered - and was greeted by a very pleasant woman who took my measurements and a few notes on how I typically wear my suits.  I was told it would take about 3 weeks before I would be able to pick up the suits.

Fast forward a few weeks and I picked up my suits (without trying them on - big mistake on my part) on the date that was originally promised.  I took them to a business trip two days after picking them up, and that's when I first noticed that the alterations were not done very well.  Specifically one arm was longer than the other, one of the jackets was taken in more than the others, and the hem on the pants was not completed.  Luckily I brought one of my other suits with me so I was able to wear that for my trip, but had I not brought that I would've been in a tough spot. 

I brought the suits back shortly after returning - and the staff immediately apologized for the errors and promised to make it right.  I understand mistakes happen, and having paid for the alterations prior to trying on the work I agreed to have them make the necessary changes.  Again, the people here are extremely nice - however as you'll read momentarily this is where the customer service takes a turn for the worst.  At the time of dropping off the suits (for a second time), I was given another 3 week turnaround.  

On the day that my suits were supposed to be ready, I received a call saying that it will be a few more days - which was completely fine as I was more concerned about the quality of work vs. a quick turnaround time.  I proceeded to come back two weeks after (now 17 days after they said it would be done) and the suits were still not ready.  The staff asked that I return the next day as she had to make a few more changes.  I then dropped in the next morning and much to my dismay - I was told they were still not ready - and I noticed that the staff was working on a completely different garment.  Given the fact that the shop had my clothing for roughly 9~ weeks at this point i would've expected for the staff to have prioritize my order to make it right.  

Finally that afternoon I received a call that my suits were ready to go..

If I wanted to play it safe, I would get pad Thai, but nope! Well, the consistency of the curry was a little more watery than I'd like, and I wasn't liking the look, but the taste! The taste was there y'all!!! It was delicious!!! Also had some crab Rangoon's that had curry too!! Whaaat!? They were good, but all together with the meal I ordered, a bit curry'ed away. HAHAHA!!! The atmosphere was super cute!! The service, weeeelllllll, you don't normally go to a Thai restaurant because of the service. Unfortunate. But from my experience, true. Actually, quick story I'll tell that one of my employees told me from his visit... he ordered pad Thai and also tried to order two sushi rolls. The waitress told him that was too much food & she'd bring him one roll and he could order another one after if he wanted! OMG! Do you believe that? He said he ended up ordering another and he had to wait a while for it because the restaurant was busier now. That's cray! Sorry y'all! Had to  take off a star for that one! Let people order what they want! Why would you turn away money! Crazy talk!! Oh! Dessert!! I asked for a recommendation over the phone, but the girl was NOT interested in humoring my sweet tooth. I ordered some anyway and went with the little Thai doughnuts. They were doughnuts alright. Sweet and doughy. With some syrup on the side. Almost like little pancakes!! They did the desserts job.

Tampa Riverwalk is a great place to experience the beauty of Tampa on the Hillsborough River. Family and friends along with your children and pets have access to this. There is a nice clean walk way with beautiful water views and scenery of different landmarks of Tampa including Straz Performing Arts, Glazer, Sono  Cafe, Curtis Hixon, and University of Tampa to name a few.

You can park your boat,  and take a walk. You can even rent a bike, and take a bike ride on the Riverwalk.

It is a great location too because some of the hotels have the Riverwalk as their view, or back. You can just walk in the back of the hotel to get there.

In my opinion, the Riverwalk is even better at night. You get to see the glow from the lights, and it is just is a serene, nice place to be. There are lots of benches too if you want to take a break from your walk.

If you don't consider yourself a foodie, I garuntee you will be after your first few minutes walking through this place. To simply put it, the Reading Terminal Market is heaven. I'm surpised they don't have a Golden gate and angels at the entrance. There is every kind of cusine you can think of and it is all authentic and as fresh as can be. A few of the restaurants in there have been featured on food network tv shows. And many of the places are Zagat rated. For you sweets lovers, they have a whole aisle of just that and if you don't see what you're looking for on display, there's a few places that can make any dessert/ cake you body/ mind desires. This place is so amazing, I can't even say what my favorite restaurant is. There's just waaaay too many! To add to that, they also have amazing coffee, book stores, a nut stand, Amish stand, ice cream stands, cookie stands, an oyester bar, exotic grill chees stand, bee wax product stand, fresh bread stands, a few vegetable and seafood stands with unbeatable prices and products, just to name a few. They occasionally events/ shows around the food court which makes it almost too much to handle. Annnd difficult to navigate. Speaking of navigating, that's my only complaint about this place. It gets super, ridiculously, unbelievably crowded on the weekends. But that's only because it's clearly one of the best things that Philly has to offer.

1.  Fungi Pizza (Absolutely Delicious!)
2.  Haymaker Pizza (Its a good substitute when you're craving a ""meaty"" supreme)
3.  French fries... so yummy!
4.  Chickpea parm...  like a chicken parm, but with a fried chickpea patty (Be careful, they are super hot when served...  I have burned the roof of my mouth a few times with these delicious items)
5.  Their cookies :)  They are baked in shop in Bethlehem (I think..) but brought in so they are fresh.  They are SO good...  I have to eat one every time we go.  

Their other sandwiches are okay, but I don't crave them, and I didn't care for the wings.  The texture was a bit off and they were over sauced.  There are some other places in town that make splendid wings (e.g. Fergies), and unfortunately, Blackbird did not stand up.  

Other items to comment on:

1. The food is  a bit pricey, but that is to be expected at most specialty food shops (and I'll happily pay a bit more to not have think about each ingredient in my food selection).

For one, the indoor space is open and airy and my eyes dont feel like theyre scanning the interior for Waldo--it's not busy, just simple and clean.

And of course the product. The coldbrew is my favorite. It tastes like coffee without a bite (that is, it doesnt come with an acidic taste). I've had the mocha before which is also good on colder mornings and days. All of what they serve lacks that secret ""burned water"" ingredient of a lot of coffee chains.

The first time was on 06/24/12 picked up at Orlando, Fl for one day and car returned back to Tampa, Int'l, Fl the next day. At the time of the Orlando office, I was offered optional insurance coverage, I told the agent to decline all, my AAA insurance card was accepted and everything went fine with the rental.  The big problem came from the 2nd rental at Tampa Int'l on 06/30/12.  We rent for 8 days and car return to Orlando, Int'l.  At the time, the lady agent tried her every effort to sell me and even pressure me on the optional insurance coverage which I had declined once from my last car rental.  It was additional of $26.99 per day X 8 days = $215.92.  I told her that our AAA insurance and American express card will cover the optional insurance and my last rental at Orlando was accepted my AAA card.  She told me that she didn't need the card. Then, I was told from her that Tampa is different than Orlando. I then told her that my insurance agent told me that it will cover and she began to say things can happen...if my rental car ended up in the auto shop, our AAA will not cover the cost of lost daily rental.  I told her that we will be staying in our timeshare resort, very safe and we will not drive out that much. However, she threatens me that it can happen because it was happened to her in a resort with her car and etc...After 25 minutes of all talks, I finally told her just declined everything and I need to get going.  In return, she answered okay & fine with very dismay voice and told me to sign in the box to agree my rental.  I then signed in a black box trusted the agent waived all optional insurance.  She printed the estimate invoice, inserted into the paper sleeve. By then, I was very tired, without checking my invoice and gone pick up my car. (I am a believer in ""honest system"".) During whole rental time, my wife was with me and listened to all whole conversations.  However, I would never think that the agent would add on the optional insurance to my rental after the long declined talks!!! I found out the extra charges until my car returned to Orlando, Int'l on 07/07/2012. My invoice came out $449.78 instead of $233.86.  My daily rental rate is only $17 dollar and the additional insurance was $26.99 per day?! I complained the wrong charges at the airport office, I told them the whole story and the answer we received was nothing that they can do, transaction was posted, it was rented from them and it's our responsibly to read thru all fine lines before signing!!  I was told to contact the corporate customer service department. 
My wife contacted them this morning, I was told that was my fault that I did not read all fine lines before signing and my agent have nothing to do with it.  But that's not true, she had the computer and all function keys, just like at McDonald's, I requested no mustard or cheese and the agent will able to key in all request.  In additional to my signing, the agent did not tell me the amount that I am signing off.  It' was the same way I signed from Orlando Dollar's.  My answer from dollar's corporate was that they are not McDonald's!!! 
I am extremely upset that Dollar's Tampa Int'l have such dishonest business practice and also allowing and backing their employee up to do that kind of things.

They have a robust Happy Hour that runs from 5-8pm Tue - Fri with $5 food and $5 drinks.  Until $8pm !! Incredible deal for late working folks. 

My favorite cocktail is Le Petit Mort which has a rosemary infused vodka, gin, lemon juice, rosemary simple syrup and grapefruit juice, shaken and then strained into a glass with a blow-torch seared spear of fresh rosemary (such a dramatic sight for the whole bar to see). I want to try other cocktails, but always am drawn to Let Petit Mort. The Hurricane is also delicious. They have fresh beers on tap flown in direct from NOLA, so Acadia is the only place in Philly that serves Abita Amber Lager. Red and White wines are also on tap and served by the glass, 1/2 carafe or full carafe.

I love the Viet-Cajun Boil which is super flavorful as is, while my husband likes Burn Yo' House Down style, which is super hot. The shrimp Étouffée has deep flavors and the Creole Jambalaya is outstanding. I also enjoyed the Blackened Catfish with collard greens and mashed potatoes one evening. The remoulade sauce on the Shrimp Po Boy is classic tasty. While the roll is about 6"", it was plenty for me as it is served with seasoned fries. The chicken wings are the best I've ever had, with deep, soulful Cajun flavors. 

I just went for brunch this past weekend and was not disappointed. Bottomless Mimosas with whatever juice you prefer for $18. All the classic lunch and dinner Acadia dishes and then some great new breakfast options.

The meats were so flavorful, I decided that I would buy a full week's worth of meats.  Every meal this past week has been very good.  I can tell these meats are of better quality and much better handling than what I was buying at the grocery stores.  I still buy my seafood from the grocery store, as they don't have a very large selection of fish here.  The pricing on beef and pork products are comparable to those found in grocery stores, but I find the price of their poultry to be on the high side.  However, the quality of their boneless/skinless chicken breasts cannot compare to the grocery stores.  I wish they sold cage free eggs.  Did you know that eggs with a yellow or light orange yoke come from unhealthy chickens - resulting in their eggs being unhealthy, too?  Also, the round shapes of these colored yokes are not what a healthy egg yoke looks like.  Eggs from a healthy chicken are actually oval deep orange.  Such eggs will be very healthy and nutritious, unlike the yellow or light orange yoked ones we have been getting pretty much all of our lives.  I mentioned this about eggs, because if this company is able to provide us with such quality meats at reasonable prices, I figure if they sold eggs, as well, they would be of a very high quality, with oval dark orange yokes - at a reasonable price.   If you haven't tried any of their meats, I highly recommend you do and start buying your meats from them.  You won't be disappointed!",2017-04-21 10:11:36,positif,positif

Some time back, I commissioned Stephen to build my wife and I our dream tandem. We talked on the phone, via email, shared concepts and we finally came to agreement on the details and I paid a down-payment for him to get started.

I had very specific items I wanted to use for components and boxed them up and sent them away to BCW - including wheels built by Peter Jon White.

A month or two later, I got a message from Stephen stating that they have used up my deposit funds and needed additional money to continue - I obliged he charged my credit card again.

A month or two later, I again received a message from Stephen asking for more money as he once again has gone through the funds I had sent. This time I asked for status on the build - he said that they were still working and he had trouble with the plating, but he would catch up shortly and be back on track. He ended up charging my card again.

A month or two later, I again received a message asking for more money. This time I had asked for pictures of the progress he has made - he couldn't provide any.

Frustrated already, I demanded to see something he has done to make me feel comfortable with the build process. He then finally admitted that he had not made any progress on the build, but he needed money to keep his shop open.

I am now furious with Stephen and decide to move on and get my money back as there was no telling how long it would be before I receive our tandem. I ask for my money back - he replies that he doesn't have it to give to me.

OK - now I'm beside myself with anger. Not only do I not have our tandem after more than 6 months waiting, but he is telling me I cannot get my money back either.

I then remembered that payment was always made by my credit card. I tell Stephen that I will file a claim with my CC company and get my money back that way. He asks that I do not do that, that I should just wait until he has more money to reimburse me.

No way am I going to trust this guy any longer, and I also am way behind on my custom tandem build. I decide to file the claim anyhow and get my money back from them that way.

I can only imagine what his issues are, but I wouldn't trust this guy considering my experience and lies from Stephen.

Oh, in the end, I did get my parts back - I was surprised as I thought they were long gone.",2012-03-19 19:46:23,négatif,négatif

Check-in was easy. They have a dedicated SPG Plat/Gold desk, however no one was attending when I checked-in at 9:45pm. 

As an SPG Platinum, I was upgraded to an Executive Suite. It basically was like the size or probably two regular hotel rooms there. But it was nice... there was a wet bar, refrigerator, separate bedroom ... nice living area with sofa and the windows all had blinds that opened up. My room had a view looking south Canal Street... so I could see Harrah's Casino and the river in the background. The sunrise over the river was beautiful!

The staff was extremely friendly.... especially the bell man, the valet guys, and the waitstaff at Roux Bistro. Speaking of, breakfast at Roux Bistro was very good. 

I had NO issues whatsoever with the elevators. They must have fixed since a previous poster had mentioned comments. It was a different elevator system than I've ever seen... people were confused. Basically you type the floor number you want to go and it would reply back the elevator letter to jump in. It worked though... and it was fast.

After the cemetery portion, we took a break at the visitor's center where we were able to grab a drink and have a bathroom break which was nice.
George then pointed out on a map the geography of New Orleans and talked a little about Katrina, which was a nice addition to the tour.

For whatever reason, I still don't love it here. All the pieces seem to be there, yet it just seems to fall short. I've dined a couple times before a show at Powell and made sure to get there plenty early based on other reviewers bad service experiences. I never had any major issues. Both times our server was friendly and the food came out very quickly. There was a small wait for the bill and once the server forgot to take off our coupon, but other than that it was fine.

I almost always order grilled cheese when it's on the menu, so I made sure to try the Royal Grille - white cheddar and mozzarella with apple slices. I really only have one demand when I order a grilled cheese and that's that the cheese be thoroughly melted and hot when delivered. This one wasn't. The cheese looked like it was melted at one point, but sat in the kitchen too long and hardened up again. I realize it's hard when there are four other entrees, but a grilled cheese is really time sensitive so please get it to the table asap.

The sandwiches come with a choice of salad or chips and both the St. Louis City salad and Stutz salad are both good. The STL City salad tastes exactly like the Pasta House salad. The Stutz is a little more inventive with goat cheese and an interesting dressing.

The best thing I've tried on the menu is the Blackhawk. This is something I would never order, but my husband got it and I tried it and it was delicious. The rolls were super soft and the spread of olive oil, basil, garlic, and goat cheese was a perfect complement.

The Focaccia Florentine was a let down. It's a very small piece of focaccia covered in basically spinach artichoke dip topped with two tomato slices.

On to dessert. It might be a little unfair to rate dessert since I'm not a huge ice cream person and much prefer cakes, pies, tarts, etc., but oh well. I've only ordered the pineapple inside out cake since it's only one of two items on the menu that isn't all ice cream. It is really good. I love their whipped cream and carmel sauce. Very good.

So basically the food is OK and I wouldn't go here just for the ice cream. It is a really awesome idea for a restaurant/soda fountain and I'm glad it's here, it's just not one of my favorites.",2011-01-01 22:42:35,neutre,neutre

The flavors of the Elder Cider were perfect for the transition into fall - warm spices reminiscent of this time of year and a floral note, so you don't cave to the fall flavors too quickly! Nachos are my guilty pleasure and there are 3 things that I look for in good nachos - thick, crispy chips that don't get overly soggy, good distribution of toppings, and flavor - these nachos hit all the marks! The only thing that would have made them better would be a drizzle of cheese sauce, because I admittedly like both melted cheese and cheese sauce on my nachos. The pork carnitas tacos were juicy and they did not skimp on the filling. Only downside is a single layer of the tortillas, which can lead to tacos that fall apart easily. 

While we enjoyed our time overall, at 6pm on a Thursday, they did have 2 kicked kegs from the short draft list offered, which was a little frustrating for the beer drinkers in our group. 

Pro tips: reservations are highly recommended - don't be late! You'll get a $10 fee tacked onto your resy. Have a crew of 4+?

My boyfriend and I love coming her for breakfast on our days off together and have been going consistently since I moved to Idaho in September. This morning we decided to stop by for breakfast and we're seated right away as always. The waitress (who seemed new) was and older woman who was lovely initially. Took our drink orders and food orders right away. Then things got interesting, when she came back to check on us before our food arrived she tried to refill my hot chocolate with coffee insisting that I had coffee. When the food arrived she got our orders mixed up. Which isn't a big deal at all and we weren't phased by it. 

Looking at the food everything looked great as always but because I ALWAYS order my eggs over easy I tend to jiggle my plate to do a quick check on my eggs and they seemed a little to wiggly. (I've been a server in a breakfast joint so I know how the eggs should be set when you move the plate) By this time our waitress had left the table. I cut into my eggs and they are literally not cooked. I get it, over easy is a runny egg which is never fully cooked but these eggs were completely uncooked. The egg whites looked like they do when you first crack an egg. I wait patiently for our waitress to return to request them recooked. When I explained the issue she looked at me and stated "" Over easy eggs are always like that. "" with quite a lot of attitude. I explained how they were supposed to be cooked and her response was "" well that's how over easy eggs are cooked here, they're fine. "" at this point I'm baffled by the fact she's arguing about this when you can clearly see clear gunk all over my plate. She takes my plate and with again a lot of attitude says she'll have them remade. She comes back and says she showed her manager and he said it's fine and they'll be remade. But you can tell she's not happy about it and that she didn't believe there was anything wrong. I get it she didn't cook the food but come on... you can't argue that the food was not cooked at all. The manager then brought my new plate to the table and our waitress barely came back to the table to check on us. She instantly gave us our check and didn't come back to refill any drinks. It sucks that this is the experience we had to deal with at one of our favorite restaurants. I'll go back because the food is amazing but I will NEVER allow her to be our server again.

POu9lFB0tWv2oYbm0nQKtg,ppsm8EDKjA1fp1yTCP3RrQ,gnpyyeWQ53WlDMJEq-YA_w,3,0,0,0,"I'm going to be a little tough on this place because I expected absolute greatness, and I got something a little short of that.  

First, the food.  It is excellent, don't get me wrong.  I enjoy Mr Garces' work.  This was no different.  But, I was looking to be absolutely wowed by everything I ate.  I'd say I was mildly wowed by one thing I ate, and not as wowed by the other.  

The better choice was the short rib sandwich.  That was well constructed and very tasty.  It was also 10 bucks for a sandwich the size of my palm.  Now, I knew that going in.  I know the prices are what they are at a restaurant like this and I expect that.  I'm just saying that when you pay 10 bucks for a sandwich the size of your palm, it better be close to the best thing you ever ate in your life.  

The Albondigas were basically unusually flavored meatballs surrounding a poached egg in a special sauce with a couple of pieces of bread.  While I enjoyed their flavor, it wasn't special to me.  For 10 bucks, I want to get wowed.  I don't want to think that I've had meatballs just as good at a Delco firehouse wedding. 

So that's the food, and I'm basing the three star review on that alone.  The following is just the rantings of a guy from Delco trying to figure out this whole Philly trendy dining scene.  

Being one person trying to dine here without a reservation on a Saturday night, I realize that is a challenge.  I asked about tables and was told there wouldn't be one until 9.  I get that.  I'm asking a lot by showing up without notice, and there isn't much space at the crowded bar.  

Of course, the reason there wasn't much space is that two girls decided to save a third seat for their friend who was showing up later (to the point that when I asked if the end seat was open, they said it wasn't, moved to that seat, and put all of their stuff on the middle seat between them... and that person didn't show up for the entire time I was there), and a party of three who sat down at the bar before me decided to stay at the bar even after being offered a table in the dining room.  This while knowing there were people wanting to sit at the bar all along.  Their apologies to me were hollow.  If you get a table, take the table and let some standing people at the bar have a shot.  Just my opinion, and a reason why I don't frequent Center City trendy spots nearly as much.  I could be wrong but I consider these things ignorance.  

So I got to stand up in the back of the bar and eat off a counter like I was at Pat's Steaks.  While I accept it as a natural part of the layout of this place, let's just say it didn't add to my experience one bit.  I know some of these Garces locations have little space.  It's part of the deal (I'm a veteran of Village Whiskey next door and I have been turned away more than once).  I'm just saying that part of the experience isn't exactly a plus.  

Again, if you're going to cramp the layout of an area of the restaurant like that, you'd better have the best food I ever had for those prices.  It didn't happen.",2011-11-06 21:50:26,neutre,neutre

I actually think my meal there was the worst edible food I've ever been presented in a restaurant.  It's not that it was vile, stale, or of some other unappetizing quality, but rather, it was some of the most tasteless, bland, and overall unenjoyable food I've ever been served.

Ordered some sort of quesadilla that consisted of chicken and a variety of undercooked vegetables that would be better suited for a chicken pot pie.  Everything was thrown under a flour tortilla blanket, which makes me question the bold liberty which was taken when writing the menu and calling this dish a quesadilla.  Also, the store-bought salsa and small bunch of generic nacho chips on the side didn't do any favors.

I'd love to go into the bare specifics of what made it so awfully tasteless, but I feel as though it's not even worth any sort of description.  My two fellow diners had better experiences, but were both highly underwhelmed with their respective Thai dishes.

My GF bowl was basically some queso, 1 fried egg, a good sauce and allot of tortilla. No beans or meat which I had always thought was standard for chilaquiles. 

My dish was $16 and hers was $12. I feel like we could have gotten allot more filling meal of traditional brunch fare at our usual spots which I prefer for a brunch when I skip normal 8am breakfast.

I needed a quick lunch in Center City and as usual Yelp delivered. While I wanted to spend veritable hours wandering in Reading Terminal Market, I politely battled my way to the back wall occupied by Meltkraft and settled in to wait. The line was short - only 3 people ahead of me - and I needed every second of that time to angst about which of their entertainingly-named chalkboard offerings I would spend my hard-earned money on.

I finally settled on the Brielle, as I was feeling sweet at that moment, with a side of tomato soup, although I was sorely tempted by the Melter Skelter and its promise of pickled green tomatoes. My sandwich took 4-5 minutes to make, which I spent chatting amicably with the staff and getting recommendations for the best mocha nearby. And then... oh god. From the first bite of this perfect creation, I knew that there was nothing more that I wanted to eat for the rest of my life. The creamy texture of the melted brie was just where I wanted it, with the slight crunch of its caramelized onions and the delicious sweetness of the accompanying raisins providing the perfect accompaniment. It only got better when dipped in the roasted tomato soup, which created a fantastic savory contrast. 

Chips? Eh. Crumble some up and put them in the soup, or just ignore them. Whatever. Follow it up with a black & white from 4th Street Bakery and you'll be much happier.

Our waiter showed up immediately and introduced himself, and gave us time to look through the wine list.  We never felt rushed or forgotten.  We settled on a simple Spanish Syrah ( their wine prices are reasonable). 

After the presentation of the wine, the waiter went through the menu with us and answered all of our questions.  To me that is a plus when the wait staff knows the menu.

The two appetizers were outstanding!
The roasted cauliflower drizzled with truffle
oil was amazing and it came with with crema that was blended with feta cheese that was indescribable.  The pork belly was seasoned and cooked to perfection.

The Etch salad was good, but I could have gone for more cauliflower.  

Now the entree, I had the fillet, med. rare, sitting on top of puree of potatoes, and dressed with peeled asparagus.  The fillet was so good, ate all of my steak and left the sides there.  Needed room for dessert.

These wings were the same size as the place that night before which doesn't try to make them sound bigger.  They use a dry rub on the wings.  I went with medium and it was pretty well flavored.  I think I should have tried hot to push my limits as this was an easy medium spice. 

The sides were a big let down here.  I ordered Mac N Cheese and compared to the place the night before  blewh.  I gave it to my wife who liked it better than the night before.  The fried Okra was pretty good, doesn't have much flavor but I could eat that over beans or potato salad.  The beans were your basic canned beans and the potato alas could have been made at any grocer.  

My wife ordered the paperback cheese and tenders.  They deep dry a pepper jack grilled cheese and then place tenders on top.  She order it lightly mild and it was mild.  The tenders were decent size and good quality meat.  The deep fried cheese sandwich tasted like a large cheese stick.  I wish they would have added cheese with more of a kick.

When I walked in, I was not greeted and kind of stood in the middle of the shop looking to see if anyone would actually come say anything to me.  

Gerber (i only remember the name because it is uncommon) came and handed me a form to fill out and then came back to give me a book of pictures.  My hair at the time was short, as I was in the process of growing it out from a short cut.  There was no relaxer in my hair, and I was wearing it as a wash n go (learned the term later), so my hair appeared extra curly and fine.  It was actually loaded with gel giving it that appearance.  Gerber never touched my hair and she sat across from me in a chair the whole time (some consultation).  She didn't even look like she was interested, and acted as if she was sleepy or too tired to talk to me.

The food is great all the time, but you absolutely must try the Sunday buffet. On Sunday they switch to their ""authentic"" menu and the proportion of Chinese clientele greatly increases which is always a good sign.

The owners are amazing. When I lived in that part of town I went all the time, and to this day the owner still remembers and teases me about my obsession with bubble tea. He has even sneaked the occasional to go cup of it to me (though I promised I wouldn't tell so, shhhh).

First off, the prices at this place cannot be beat! 

Food - I will need to order something different next time.  I got the chicken in clay pot, chicken soup and the vegan summer roll.  The vegan summer role was not very good.  I have had summer rolls at other places that are far better and the dipping sauce far more authentic.  The chicken soup was lack luster and had thick rice noodles in it.  The noodles were not cooked very well and basically took over the entire dish.

My main dish was alright.  It was just chicken with green beans.  It was cooked well but just seemed off with the jasmine rice.  Maybe the chicken should be eaten by itself or with some sort of sauce.  It was not very good in my opinion.

Restaurant interior is basic.  Just tables upon tables and simple table clothes.

There are many options for tacos in the city but I keep coming back here. I have had the Shrimp Tacos, the Korean Tacos, Chicken Quesadilla, Fries, Plantains, Chips and Guac, and Churros. 

Appetizers: Chips and guac are always fresh and delicious, a little on the pricey side compared to other places around the city, but they give a good portion and it's tasty so it's not a problem

The fries here are plentiful and the Mayo dipping sauce is a perfect touch. I love french fries, but would rarely get them at a taco spot. This place is the exception.

Entrees: Korean Tacos are FANTASTIC! I want to try something new every time, but I just can't get myself to do it. The short ribs are tender, there is a nice kick, the kimchi isn't overpowering and the chipotle mayo brings a coolness to the dish. I strayed once and got the Shrimp Taco and it was a mistake, it just couldn't compete.

My wife gets the chicken quesadilla, she's pretty particular about her quesadillas and she keeps going back

Dessert: Churros and Plantains. The churros are crispy and the two sauces (chocolate and dulce de leche) were outstanding, I want to dip everything in it. Those plantains are some of the best I've had. They come with a honey and peanut crumble, the stickiness, crunch, and soft plantain come together nicely and it's a hefty portion.

Our waiter was very very accommodating. He acknowledged my Yelp offer for 1 free artisan dipper when you check into the location. Even though he has never seen it he made sure he talked to the manager and they took it off on the bill. So that was really great! He was polite and quick given he had A LOT of tables to take care of. He explained everything for us to make sure we got the best dining experience. We did the Alpine cheese dip (my favorite), 2 Caesar salads, 1 classic entree, and the s'mores dessert fondue. The bill came out to be 51$ !!! Talk about saving money, usually for two people it's 100$++ ... but I have been here before and know how much food it could be and I got smart when ordering. We decided to share an entree because the cheese fondue plus the salad is already filling before the dinner comes out. And we had plenty room for the dessert. 

I believe our waiters name was Silver? He was absolutely great! We had such a great experience. 

Also, a tip is to try not to order any drinks, it helps with the bill later on. Granted there cocktails are amazing! But if you wanna save money either drink before or after. Going there for the fondue experience is the best.",2020-03-15 17:26:53,positif,positif

v_mfMOBnOZ_XrCPTaeBFNg,_PrFvraLaOeZgb6CIVN08A,7Pq3EBuMucjvt0NMRxD-vQ,1,5,0,0,"My first appointment was a routine visit. The doctor briefly looked into my ear, and decided that I needed a CAT scan, and then told me to make a follow-up appointment in 4 to 6 weeks. The following week, I had the CT scan done, and then I made my appointment for 4 weeks after my initial visit. 
Two days before the second appointment, I received a bill in the mail that was higher than what my insurance company Explanation of Benefits (EOB) said I had to pay. I called the billing person, and right off the bat, she was very rude, stating that I needed to pay what they charged. If I didn't know any better, the way she handled this made me think this is a common event. I decided that I would bring the bill in, so that I could discuss this fault in person, perhaps with someone with more poise and consideration.
On the day of my scheduled appointment, I showed up on time. The front desk person said that in order to be seen, I needed to pay today's co-payment, plus the remaining balance. I stated I would pay today's co-payment, but that I would like to resolve the error in the unpaid balance. She stated that I would need to speak with the Office Manager, and resolve any billing issues prior to being seen. I told her that I had just received the bill only two days before. She said that it didn't matter, and that payment was expected now.
I waited 20 minutes in the waiting room for the Office Manager. He led me to an office, and stated that I needed to pay the bill undisputedly. I showed him the Explanation of Benefits from the insurance company, showing I owed less than this bill. After asking me if I was really going to dispute 15$, he agreed that I owed less, and it needed to be paid now. He was curt, rude, and also showed signs of a person who deals with sort of thing often. I told him that I was upset that I had been forced to miss my appointment that I had showed up on time for, because of an error in their billing.  I then told him that this office seems to care more about getting paid than their patients.  To that, he stated that they are just ""trying to stay afloat"". (I couldn't believe he said that, we are talking medicine here, and everyone knows that Doctors, especially Specialty Doctors are not usually struggling.) I told him I would pay what the insurance stated that I owed, and that I want nothing else to do with this office. 
I would avoid this place at all costs. There are several bad reviews online, and I completely agree with them. In my opinion, this office does not care about their patients, just the amount of revenue they can generate. Patient be weary, this place is a rip off. The employees are very rude, condescending, and unhelpful.  Make sure that your bill from them backs up to what your insurance says you owe, because it is clear that they are ripping people off, are intolerant of anyone asking any questions regarding mistakes in billing (which happen more often than not), and are not there for your care or health. They exemplify everything that is wrong with healthcare, and are in the business of making money at all costs.",2015-03-17 16:15:27,négatif,négatif

Our Margheritta pizza was good: thin with a well baked crunchy crust, a smidgen of basil leaves and a few tomato slices; but it's not calling me back for more. My sangria was good, but nothing exceptional. My other half had a blood orange margarita. It was incredibly tart. We also had is simple salad. And yes it was quite simple. It was bagged leaf lettuce with four chunks of heirloom tomatoes along with a few tiny chunks of cucumber. On the menu, they say it comes with pistachio brittle. The brittle in the salad was teeny tiny slivers of sweet crunchy candies. On my pallet it didn't fit. I didn't taste any nuts so I picked them all out.

But it's the service that topped everything. The waitress was very polite. However she was absorbed with some sort of inventory device of some sort; and she along with another server were absorbed in a show on the TVs above the bar. It all resulted in me having to go up to retrieve her several times, first to order and then to get our toppings, and finally our check. She never asked if we wanted another drink or desert. I believe she never really heard me say we were there to celebrate our anniversary. 

Still the inside was really cozy and we enjoyed our time visiting. Again, another place experienced and another place I probably won't go back to.

I've been piling up a few small insurance claims for a dent here, cracked bumper there, but when my leather steering wheel started to peel, it was the last straw. NOW it was time to get the car back in shape. I have a Subaru STi, which is considered by some their pet project or child, but I am not a car girl. The peer pressure has at least forced me to keep my bright blue wagon in decent shape, whilst not diving head first into Crazed CarLand.

Getting the estimate was easy. I just walked in one afternoon and it was done by Brian in a quick fashion. Turn-around time for bumper repair, some scratch/dent repair and a new steering wheel was about 5 days. The rates for labor were on par with the other estimate I received. I cannot say the same for Subaru and their priced-as-gold-plated parts.

I wasn't able to drop it off after hours, but made it work during the day. They did require me to put a parts deposit down when dropping it off.  The estimator called when their original repair plan wasn't working out and it was going to cost me a little more. I appreciated the communication more than my wallet appreciated the added cost, which wasn't really their fault. It also added some days. In the end, the time frame was at the very far end of what they estimated (4 full business days after the original 5).

Picking up the car: it was ready right at the time they said it would be and it was, to my surprise, clean. I was recently burned by a detail downtown and haven't had it done since. I would venture to say it was probably cleaner than that $150 detail I had previously, which was about a $25-worth service.

Body work is always worry some. Unless they're props, this place always has beautiful cars parked outside and in the shop, which can be reassuring (and make you feel like you ain't as cool as you think you are). I'd definitely recommend them for these kinds of things.",2017-09-21 18:53:18,positif,positif

KLTNTHwRuUvGy8D6sMkrbA,Cs8OJiIpeKDGL85Fw8CYxA,_EiDrzfBHtXCmt7xVpLhbQ,5,11,0,1,"I'm a new tenant who just moved in about a month ago from California. I took a chance and gave a deposit before I even looked at the apartment in person, but I'm glad I did! April, the property manager, was very easy to work with and arranged for me to have my keys the Sunday night I arrived so that I wouldn't have to pay for a hotel stay :) 


Positives: 
1. The night I moved in, my freshly renovated apartment was SPOTLESS and move-in ready. I didn't have to clean ANYTHING and I'm someone who has allergies and is OCD about cleanliness. 
2. The kitchen is spacious with granite countertops, a large sink, and a decent amount of storage space. Apartment comes with your own washer/dryer too. 
3. It's safe- there is 24 hour security. Although, sometimes I do notice that the guards are away and leave the gate open but that's probably because they're attending to complaints or issues on the property. 
4. The gym is not bad and the pool area and property are well maintained. 
5. The neighbors I've met so far are very friendly. I never hear any loud music, etc. 
6. It's a very convenient location with Whole Foods, The Ochsner Medical Center, Barnes and Noble all being within a few mile radius. 
7. When I spoke to my other friends/classmates, I noticed that they paid significantly more for similar upgrades but smaller square footage. So, I'm satisfied with the rent I'm paying. 
8. The staff is very friendly and they take care of repairs and requests you make pretty fast. I accidentally dropped one of my diamond earrings in the sink and I immediately emailed April in the night to ask if someone could help me unscrew the sink pipe so I could get my earring out. Early next morning, the repairmen came over and retrieved my earring!


Negatives: 
1. I really enjoy studying and waking up to natural light, but with all the window curtains open there isn't much natural light coming into the apartment (this is a minor negative though). 
2.  I'm a an EXTREMELY light sleeper so in my bedroom I can hear cars passing by  but it's not very loud, doesn't keep me awake at night and it's something I'm getting used to. When I'm really tired, I hardly notice the noise outside.
3. I do find that the walls are thin and although I don't hear my neighbors talking, etc., I can definitely hear the shower, faucets and washing machines running. I guess the walls and pipes aren't very insulated. Again- this is a minor negative. 

Overall, the positives outweigh the negatives, so I'm overall very happy with my decision to live here and would highly recommend!",2016-02-02 01:22:13,positif,positif

I asked how the frosting the was made and she said ""Crisco"".  I'll pass on the partially hydrogenated trans fat.  When I mentioned it there was a bit of an attitude.  She said they needed it to make it fluffy and I simply informed her there were brands that didn't have trans fats, albeit more expensive.  She said she would talk to the owner, which was nice.  I mentioned I was at the City Market earlier and they had the price at 3 for $5.  She said they do not honor that price in the store and I would have to pay $2/cookie.  I tried to reason with her that I was making a special stop to visit the actual store location and she simply did not care one bit.  I ordered a snickerdoodle, brookie, ginger, and chocolate crinkle.  I tried again when I paid to get the 3 for $5 deal and was turned down.  I told her I would call the owner to mention this is poor customer service and she said ""why don't you go ahead and do that"".  Very rude when I did not have an attitude about it one bit, just trying to get it through that it was a ridiculous policy.  Anyway....to the cookies.  They are horrible!!

To start off I walked in without having an appointment the woman at the front asked me to wash my hands before getting started which is nice knowing everyone coming in starts off by washing their hands. I told the woman I wanted a pedi and a fill in for my nails. As soon as I got comfortable in the pedi chair a man immediately started setting up for the pedicure and brought out an ice cold water bottle. I'm pregnant and it was pretty hot outside so this was a nice treat. And surprisingly most places don't offer water. The man stared on my pedi, he handed me a menu with services and price list, I selected what I wanted and he began by giving me options for which pedicure scent I wanted. This was nice because iv never have the option. I picked mint 
Eucalyptus. Some of my toe nails were very short and uneven, so after the gentleman gave me a very nice relaxing pedi the women that first greeted me gave me an over lay to make them all match. She was extremely thorough and took her time. She also smoothed down my nails that I have previously had done from another shop because I told her they were bulkier then I typically like them and that if she couldn't fix it, it wouldn't be her fault.

I don't know why these other reviewers drive so far for such measly fare, however there are much yummier restaurants in SB!!

I've been here twice - once for lunch & once for dinner.
The bread is tasty & is probably the best thing offered.

The lunch visit consisted of surly service, very average & somewhat odd piccata & a decent pizza.  

The dinner visit - painstakingly slow & impersonal service...  maybe our waiter didn't care, because the gratuity was already predetermined since we were a party of 6 or perhaps because he already knew he would be bringing out miserably mediocre food.

Two friends ordered pizzas and they looked good; I ordered an Italian classic - chicken parmigiana - and it tasted like oversalted, canned sauce on soggy breaded chicken.  I had the option of subbing out the accompanying fettuccine alfredo for ""Italian broccoli"" (because ""at Pascucci, we believe in choices"" read the menu... I wish they were bigger believers in good food).  Unfortunately, the bread crumbs with garlic on broccoli was really more of a broccoli stuffing concoction - I don't know if they know this, but broccoli can't bite.... you really don't have to cook the hell out of it until all shades of green have seeped away.

First of all, I've been wanting to check this place out for a while. It stands out from the rest of the galleries in the area.

It was great to finally pay a visit while everything was in full swing for First Friday. 

[I'm not embarrassed to say that I absolutely tried to enter through the large, non-functioning wooden doors on the outside. They are gigantic, and the very notion that they could open made me very happy and feeling like Alice In Wonderland.]

The gallery interior is large as well. A show featuring downed trees from Hurricane Sandy in NYC was opening; walking into a large room with tons of abstracted, organic objects was pretty surreal. It seemed as though it would be right on cue that a very enthusiastic gallery attendant greeted us and began telling all about the artist and his show. This lady was the fun fact queen! My friend and I made our way around the show and ended up in another room where the gallery attendant started chatting with us again. She was really knowledgable and excited to engage in conversations about the work, artists, and the gallery owner himself.  I enjoyed talking to her and hearing her stories.
